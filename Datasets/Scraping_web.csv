Rese√±as
"This is the best French Restaurant in town, period. I've been there a number of times for dinner meetings and the food is extraordinary! If you're planning to travel to France simply for some fine cuisine, save yourself the trip and run to Melisse instead!"
"I have been here 3 times and have tried at least half the menu. Except for the hot and cold foie gras, everything is absolutely delicious. Prime rib is my personal favorite. From bread to dessert - you will not want to leave anything on the plate. This is the only place that makes me want to lick the plate. Everything is so refined and intricate and no matter how full I am, I always manage to finish everything on my plate. This place is almost an experience. If I win the lotto, I'd be eating here every day!"
"Overall, I give Melisse a 3 star. Maybe it has been a while since I went there, but besides the great service and the decent portion of the food, none of the food item was truly memorable. I remembered the food was good and walking out satisfied, but the restaurant did not give me the wow moment I was hoping for, especially after hearing so many good things about it. But nonetheless, it did meet my expectation of any 2 star Michelin restaurant in terms of the venue, the service, and the quality of the food."
"The 10 course tasting menu is the way to go! The favors were so refined and delicious....very well thought out! The textures of the different foods was very well done. And the presentation was so beautiful for each dish! The wait staff were very friendly and knowledgable. They didn't seem stuffy like at other high-end restaurants, and made the experience even more enjoyable.

I'd come here again for a special occasion. The 10-courses took us almost 4 hours. (We were having great conversation) Well worth it!"
"While in my heart of hearts I can't give this 5 stars, it came see dilly close. I absolutely LOVE an interactive food experience, but what I felt was lacking most, was the interaction from the sommelier to better recommend and be more personable in discussing possible pairings.

Everything from the truffles with an anniversary card, to the amuse bouche, to the wonderful assortment of breads, lobster bolognese, beef cheeks, egg and caviar and halibut was OUTSTANDING. Certainly a 2 Michelin worthy restaurant!"
"I came here for my boyfriend birthday and we both got the 10 course meal.
-Highlights-
*****Egg Caviar was spectacular!
**** 21 days age duck medium rare was good.
***** Our waiter was great she made us feel we were her only table she had.

We will be back!"
I must agree with some of the yelp comments - pretentious and overpriced. It wasn't one of the better Cal-French-Fusion experience I've had; it is definitely not a 'French' restaurant. Too much emphasis on Asian ingredients that simply didn't work for me...
"If you can afford it it's PHENOMENAL...

I have literally been here at least 10 times within the last year. This is an ""experience"" dinner, where the dinner is the night. Try their tasting menu, you will be in heaven :)

The service is hands down 1st class."
"It's a real overprice restaurant. Just nice decoration and good food design. No menu below $125.

It's a good restaurant but not at all the best meal I have ever had. Nothing special or amazing at all.

I had tried here 2 years ago and it was by far better."
"It's been some time since I've experienced a 2 Star Michelin. And this place definitely lived up to my both my recollections and expectations. The amazing things the Chef creates (especially with lobster) would be, if in full power, banned by the Tea Party."
"What more can I add that others have not already...? Basically, if you would like a unique, higher-end food experience with very rich, very tasty (and with a price tag to match) dining, this is a must. Yes, it is overpriced, especially when this place tacks on a 3% surcharge for their employees healthcare costs (am not against their healthcare, but, seriously, you charge a minimum of $135 per person for a small meal and the owner cannot find a way to cover this cost?), but the food and service are top-notch."
"Melisse has never failed me yet. The tasting menus tend to be the way to go. Even better when paired with wine. And they do have several different options so you're not necessarily stuck with just one set. In general I'm not a classic French fan, but the food here is usually spot on.

On almost every visit we've had JC stop by our table to chat. Seems like a genuinely friendly type of guy. One of the best parts about Melisse is that it is luxurious without the stuffiness. The staff is friendly, the service great though not impeccable. They time the plates, but once in a while get out of order. The side room with fireplace is nice, though can get too warm. The glass opens on the other side of the dining room making it quasi-outdoors. There is also a small bar."
"Situated on a corner of Santa Monica, Melisse is a delightful fine dining experience. The 10 course pre fixe menu seemed like a no brainer with all the different flavors and interesting sounding dishes to try. Also the overall service was great from everyone.

We particularly enjoyed the
-mint kumquat soda ""cocktail""
-Egg caviar
-oyster sea grapes
-spot prawn
-cod
-duck
-quince sorbet with earl grey jelly
-sunchoke potato soup

The cheese plate was just alright. It came with wine poached pears and candied kumquats. I liked those very much.

The Melisse tea was a great finish to the end of the meal. It left a very nice fragrant, flowery taste.

Also, fun fact: they use table cloth blemish stickers when you spill something on the table. We made it a fun little game to see who would get the least amount of stickers :) the servers were fun to talk to.

The water cups are also modern and fun to hold. I mean, it's a minor detail, but it was an interesting note.

Valet is $8.50. Still water is $9. You've been warned."
"How does a commoner like me, even as Yelp Elite as I am, review a Michelin 2 star restaurant? Well, here goes. First, the decor and environment. The outside is horrendous. Ugly distressed walls and Barney colored accents. The interior is a complete reversal. It features gorgeous tabling, lighting, and spacing that focuses all tables to the center. Second, the service. The somme and our waiter were amazing. I did the wine pairing and his descriptions of each glass were enthusiastic and on point. Our waitress Jill was so friendly and offered some great recommendations. It was up there for best service ever. Last, the food. I was expecting rich, buttery, fat lead flavors but I was very pleasantly surprised. We had 7 different courses and all featured something different. The prawn appetizer, concord grapes and goat cheese featured clean, salient, and vibrant flavor. On the flip side, my venison loin and lobster bolognese were more on the peppery, salty, and savory side.

Bottom line, it's expensive. A $600 meal for two isn't something you can do often but it was my birthday so why not. If you enjoy seeing celebrities (Brooke Burke and David Charvet were at the table next to us), eating/drinking for 3 hours, and the experience of savoring every bite, it's worth it."
"The service was EXCELLENT and the presentation was wonderful. Again the service is TOP notch from the hostess to the wait staff. Formal but friendly and not stuffy. Could not ask for a better service experience - 5 star.

It is very apparent that a LOT of effort goes into the preparation of the food but being one who prefers a ""whole food"" diet with less meat and less fat I was less enamored. I did have the vegetarian menu but still the level of processing involved was less to my liking (i.e. foams, gelees, sauces, etc). The standout for our table was the diakon radish dish and the lobster bolognese. The lamb was entirely to under cooked (we took the chefs suggested preparation) - 3 star.

The champagne choices and wine list were very nice.Their gin selection was not extensive (to be expected) but they did have Oxley and Plymoth. For tonic the do have Fever Tree (but not the naturally light version). The ice used for the cocktails was very good. From a block, very clear, and served as one large cube - 4 star.

Obviously, I am not the right customer for the food Melisse serves but I can very much appreciate the effort and care that goes into the food and top notch service provided. But for almost $1000 for 4 people I can personally only give it a 3 star overall."
"R & I plus 2 were looking for a place to eat at 9PM. Originally, we were looking for a sushi joint and stopped by Hama Sushi. Right as we pulled up front for the valet, we saw a couple who were dry humping each other right in front of the entry way. Maybe they had one too many oysters...I dunno....but I lost my taste for sushi.

Drove around Santa Monica and decided to see if Melisse would take us...and guess what? They did! Honestly, it helped to have friends who dine there quite often. Since it was 9PM, we thought it was best not to do the wine pairing but if you have the time...YOU MUST TRY THEIR CARTE BLANCHE MENU w/ the wine pairing!!!! My friends have told me that the sommelier tends to pour w/ a heavy hand.

Now with the food...
I personally had the seasonal vegetable salad which included my favorite *BURRATA* as a starter. Nothing extraordinary but it was delicious. Then, I had the lamb encrusted in black truffles as my main. Well, i have to say that this lamb ""must have been in love because it tasted so good"". (For those who watch No Reservations, you will probably remember this phrase from the Puerto Rico episode). For dessert, I had the sticky toffee pudding. This dessert was quite delicious. It was light and it didn't weigh me down. We finished dinner at like 12 and we were able to say hello to the chef. Although I didn't get to try their course meal, I still understood why they received a michelin star. I still don't understand why Lucques didn't but...it's pointless to talk about it on this review."
"Husband, daughter and I spent Thanksgiving at Melisse. Absolutely amazing. Great food, great service, nice decor where you could hold a conversation (i.e., not too loud). Wish the neighborhood was a little nicer, but overall, definitely thumbs up all around."
If you are ready to dig deep into your bank acount this is definitely the place to go. The wine and the sommelier are simply the best LA can offer. The menu and quality of food is out of this world and the service is an experience of expertise and attention.
"My birthday dinner. Chefs menu. Trust the chef, he will not disappoint.

This place is as good as everyone says, possibly a bit better. One of LA's finest, for sure.

Beautiful presentation, fresh ingredients and excellent service. What more can you ask for?"
"So nice to find a great restaurant which offers great food AND great service. It IS expensive (not compared to Tokyo or London), but you get what you pay for, and I am happy to pay for the great experience of eating foie gras while I still can in California!"
Took my friend there for her birthday. Rookie mistake to not check the menu as it was prix fixe at $135 each for the four course menu. It was divine and the unlimited bread & delicious butter was phenomenal. Wish we had more of the basil green bread SO GOOD.
"Food...some dishes really good, some not so much so.
Ambiance...very nice.
The buts: Long waits between courses, many things on the ""prix fixe"" menu are upsell items and usually cost a lot more. I don't get that. If the chef plans a menu that he wants his customers to appreciate, why are there more expensive options? The real problem with this is that usually your choices are limited to something you may not want or something that costs an extra $50 or $75. This is pretty cheesy, but if you look around at the amount of people who are working there, it explains it. I would put this restaurant more on the list of a ""dining show"" than a ""dining experience""...Your waiter takes your order then you never see him again as all courses are typically brought out by other people. I was also very disappointed in the Sommelier...he doesn't really listen to what you tell him, but always points you at the more expensive bottles. And you do get some attitude at this place....

I've been there twice...I probably won't go again."
"We decided to celebrate the holidays with a fancy dinner and Melisse was delicious and playful. Highlights of the tasting menu included the lamb and the fois gras and the lobster capellini, wreathed in a white foam. The fish course was okay but not dazzling. Two amuse bouche (grape rolled in goat cheese and pistachios; fennel flan). Dessert was wonderful as well though we were stuffed by then. It's impossible to take a white chocolate popsicle to go, though!

The restaurant was beautifully decorated, with fresh boughs of pine along the wall and upside down christmas trees hanging from the center. Smelled and looked heavenly. And of course, the little stool for my handbag.

The chef came by and he seemed proud of his Michelein and Zagat's ratings (he didn't say anything about yelp, alas)

The only nitpick: service is not as polished at Michael Mina, French Laundry or Gary Danko's. Our waiter kept trying to push the white truffles and Kobe beef special on us (some of the dishes cost as much as the tasting menu!!)"
"Wow. Just wow! I had heard about this place from a number of people and a quick trip to LA last weekend was highlighted by two things: 1) the opportunity to finally taste the food that everyone has raved about for so long and 2) to be able to do so on a reasonable budget.

The $65 July Prix Fixe Menu is incredible!

If I could, I would have licked the plate on the first course of Lobster Bolognese (you read that right). I'm not sure of all the ingredients that went into it, but it's the closest thing to perfection I have ever tasted!

The Alaskan Halibut had an exotic twist and knowing that it came from waters far away from you know where, made it that much more delightful.

By the third course (are you kidding me? I was almost stuffed already) made me wish that I could pack more into my belly. The beef was delicious!

Thankfully, the passion fruit parfait made me think I was ""cleansing my palate"" when in reality, I was thinking I better find Mr. Right to bring me back here so I can do the real (I think it's a ten course) tasting menu.

The decor, the exquisite service (it's choreographed, I swear) and the incredible food made me feel like a million bucks, but it didn't cost nearly that. Even with the tax and gratuity, I felt like I definitely got the better end of the deal.

I would eat here every single day if I could. This July tasting menu is the best bargain in town when you weigh what you pay and receive against other places that deliver less and end up costing you much, much more.

Rated with appreciation."
"My boyfriend and I had a fabulous time watching the staff create an ideal experience for any food enthusiast. The food was fantastic and explained to perfection. Please, if given the opportunity, give Melisse a chance as I assure you will not be disappointed."
"Went here again for a bday and it's still the best restaurant in Los Angeles. Got the 10 course this time versus the 14 course last time. The 10 course is much more manageable as the 14 is just too much food. Next time I'll go for the 4 course but only because now I have my favorites. If it's your first time get the 10 course to get a full exposure to the cuisine.

Going here is a serious event; dinner took 3 1/2 hours this time and over 4 hours last time. So in a way ... time wise you get your money's worth :)"
"Disappointed.

Not sure if it's due to COVID or not, but my dining experience was really sub-par. Outside seating with heaters was totally fine, service was also fine, but the food themselves were not.

The egg caviar dish was good, I'll give you that. Well cooked, intense flavor, and unique. Very nice way to start the night, and my champagne pairing was added a nice touch to it.

However, everything else - lobster pasta, venison, dessert - was nothing special.

The lobster pasta has no lobster in it and the portion was tiny. The venison was just average. The dessert (for a french Michelin place) felt like it was made by some central kitchen (or was it from Starbucks)?

Ordered a coffee post main course and it did not arrive after petite four.

Would not return."
"Tsk tsk.

I didn't write my review in hopes of receiving an apology or anything of that sort. I wrote it because I was highly dissatisfied. Regardless, I was contacted by who I can only assume is a manager of Melisse, and he apologized for the awful night I had here. I thought this was so nice of him--it even made me feel horrible about my review. He offered to send me a gift card so that they could redeem themselves on another night! I thought, ""Maybe I should update my review and give them 3 stars; after all, management isn't at fault. And if service and food is better this time around, maybe 4 stars.""

After telling the manager who my server was, he told me he would call me back to take down my information (yes, I gave him my number). Several days later, I have not heard back. Again, another offensive act by Melisse. If the manager simply wanted to know who my waiter was, I would have gladly told him. No need to lie to me! Horrible customer service practice.

I was really hoping to like Melisse, and I wanted to give them another chance. But at the most I think Melisse should have 1 Michelin Star; therefore it is way overpriced. And I have now been offended twice by this place. There will have to be some major persuasion and bribery to get me to come back again."
"Absolutely AMAZING !!!! My husband took me here for my birthday and I had the second best dinner of my life (my first best waS Providence). My favorite probably the foie gras and egg caviar. To be honest, I enjoyed all 7 courses... definitely will come back !!!"
"I""m still a fan, but their Thanksgiving dinner this year was a big let down. They did not take our drink order for half an hour after we were seated. We did not receive our food for 2 hours. It was delicious but not pleasant. Not a word of apology for the wait."
"My husband and I went to Melisse with one other couple. We had an amazing meai, and an amazing experience overall! The decor is beautiful, the presentation of the food was like works of art, and everything we ate was delicious! We will definitely be back again!"
"Not to miss. Everything is creative, exceptionally executed with some pleasurable surprises. Not the French Laundry but as a 3-star in Santa Monica, it's a must for those who appreciate this caliber of service, dazzling flavors and kind of hedonism on Wilshire."
"Had a high expectation before going there, but the dining experience wasn't anything specially. Ordered 4 courses meal, add couple courses from other menus. I admit that they are good food, but definitely do not deserve 2 Michelin stars. The service is what disappointed me the most, take forever for me to get my server. When I ask to see the wine menu, I'll get responses:"" one second sir, let me get your server""..... I mean, C'mon.. Just grab my menu please. None of other Michelin restaurants I've been have such poor services. They often go extra miles to make sure you have the best dining experience.

But heard the Ten courses menu is better, double I would go back and try tho..

2 stars for the service, 4 Stars for the food. Overall 2 stars.

Michelin stars - 0"
"Melisse serves upscale French cuisine that makes for an excellent special occasion outing. We were here for a seven course dinner and left utterly full and satisfied! The ambiance was elegant and modern, and the service was perfectly orchestrated. Every food crumb was swiped off the table and water glasses were never empty. Execution was consistently spot on and the menu really showed off a lot of the flavors of the season.

Each dish was eloquently explained as they came out. Some highlights of the menu:

-Wagyu Tartare: perfectly dressed, perfect kick from the horseradish and citrusy flavor from the sorrel!
-Egg Caviar: one of Melisse's highlights, truly savory and decadent.
-Foie Gras Terrine: loved the foie gras but loved it even more that the dish was decorated with persimmon, my favorite fruit, and flavors of ginger and pistachio.
-Stonington Maine Scallop: fresh and tender scallops paired nicely with the seaweed broth.
-Prime Beef Rib Eye Cap: served half smothered in porcini mushroom sauce which added a pleasant twist to the traditional rib eye.

I also loved the beautiful assortment of bread that came out fresh and warm. The pesto brioche and olive roll were so dank!

Parking is available through valet or on the meters. Do not park in the residential area."
"Really? This is what people in Los Angeles consider a fine restaurant? There are two tastes here that prevail..Bland and salty. There is not much in between. I have spent half of my life in France and half in NY and have eaten at many two and three star Michelin restaurants. This is not in the same league. Not even close. Over wrought presentations, with tasteless combinations. Honestly, I have been here three times now and the food has gotten so flavorless (unless you consider salt a flavor) that spending this kind of money to have your plates revealed simultaneously is not worth it. There are far more interesting restaurants at half the price in Los Angeles than this place. Melisse is about show, and money, and how much they can get away with in a city that praises appearance over substance. Do yourself a favor and save yourself a lot of money. I recently ate at Jean-Georges restaurant in Trump tower in NY and spoke to him about dining in Los Angeles as I have known him for fifteen years. When I discussed my meal ay Melisse with him and my utter disappointment, he sheepishly admitted that he too had one of the worst meals in Los Angeles there and then proceeded to send over five of the most delicious things I have ever tasted. Stay away. You will be glad you did."
"I went here for dineLA with 3 friends and I usually don't write reviews on Yelp but I was compelled to because I was so shocked this formerly 2 Michelin star and 4 1/2 Yelp starred restaurant was so underwhelming. Our entire table felt the same way and I'm being generous with the 3 stars.
We all ordered different items from the dineLA prix-fixe menu so we could try everything. There were a few call outs of good dishes - the Cara Cara Orange Yogurt dessert was both beautiful in presentation and delicious in taste. The oyster appetizer wasn't super special but points for great presentation again and it was tasty as well.
Everything else was underwhelming and just okay. Nothing was bad, but they weren't that special or particular. And, the prime beef cap was well cooked but a little too salty in flavoring, the truffle chestnut soup was good in consistency but a little too sweet, and the Atlantic cod was so underwhelming you felt like you could get similar at Malibu Fish Grill.
The service was on point for the most part but there were a couple times where I did have to flag down a waiter (busboy or two to get our waiter) and they didn't hear or see me at first. Ordinarily this wouldn't be a big deal but a restaurant of this caliber should have exceptional service as opposed to average service.
Like I said, nothing really terrible but it was completely underwhelming across the board. It felt more like a $30+ meal restaurant as opposed to a $100+ meal. We all wanted our money back and regretted picking Melisse for our dineLA experience.
I'm no stranger to this kind of fine dining experience having gone to Providence, Joel Robuchon, and Patina before to name a few. I don't understand the 4 1/2 Yelp stars. Save your money for Providence & Joel Robuchon which are exceptional."
"I was a little concerned about returning here simply because we had such an incredible meal before and I wanted to keep that memory alive. My girlfriends, my son and I came here for an early birthday celebration and re-visited the 10-course tasting menu consisting of the freshest seasonal ingredients available.

This time, the menu was heavy on seafood -- which wasn't a problem for me, but my son is generally not a seafood lover -- with one meat dish, lamb.

We began with an amuse bouche BEFORE the real amuse bouche on the menu. This was grapes prepared two ways. Then, an amuse bouche of scallop was presented. I noticed that not every table were given the same amuse bouche so you might get a different from from your neighbor's.

The first course was the same as our visit before -- the caviar egg -- one of my favorites on the menu. A soft poached egg is topped with lemon creme fraiche and caviar and is just orgasmically mindblowing on the palate. I think we were all silent while eating this. Even my son, who isn't fond of runny eggs and fishy foods devoured it with relish.

I won't go into every course because they change depending on what's available, but each dish was exquisitely cooked and plated. I usually look around to see which plate is the prettiest so I can photograph that particular one, but each plate was identical to the next.

Fish dishes were sublime, delicate and absolutely breathtaking, something I wish my experience at le Bernardin a month ago had been.

It was definitely an experience to watch my 12-year-old eat every fish course without complaining and smile at me when his dish was empty. I was so proud of him, but more than that, I knew that in order for my child to polish everything off his plate meant that it was just plain delicious!

I can't afford to visit Melisse a lot, but on those rare special occasions, this is THE place to go to. I was afraid that this time around I wouldn't be blown away like I was the first time, but I was wrong. It was just as good! Sorry for doubting you Josiah Citrin!"
"Tremendously disappointing. My wife and I are teachers therefore this was a hefty chunk of change to spend on a meal. We have eaten at four other Michelin starred restaurants and this was the worst.

We ate the 10 prefix menu.

Appears to be a culinary school and back with very young Cooks coming out introducing themselves a chef. Our first cook tonight was a talented young lady who nailed the oyster with cauliflower custard and the famous caviar egg dish. That had our hopes High but the rest of the meal did not live up to those firdt bites.

Our steak dish lacked Mallard compunds from as it wasn't browned and was very imperfectly prepared. I did notice the group at the table next to us did have correctly prepared steak which was the same dish. Clearly there are major inconsistencies.

The dishes that use truffles use them so sparingly that you could hardly tell that existed, unlike spago where we got a ridiculous quantity of truffles on our dish. The endive dish tasted of warm vomit, and I enjoy well prepared endive having cooked with it at home.

The tartiflette tasted like a toaster scramble. Not disgusting, just not something I would eat except out of early morning desperation.

The entire meal was lacking in brightness and needed more acidity. I would recommend Providence or Spago if you are looking for fine dining in LA.

I had a major surgery the next day which had a high risk of death therefore I wanted to live it up for a night. I wish I had done it somewhere else. Don't make the same mistake I did.

At least dessert was better than Providence or Spago. L'Opera dessert dish ranked up there with Juniper and Ivy's Yodle dessert. Overall, it couldn't hold a candle to the French Laundry's desert though. Even though that one dessert could have fit in fairly well there.

My poor wife is having to explain to our co-workers how not great this meal was, as I had been excitedly telling people about it for weeks. Eating a meal of this expense is roughly a once a year experience for us and was something positive I could focus on with major medical issues looming. Now everyone's asking how it was...not good.

Price is definitely factoring heavily into my review. One disgusting dish, 3 great dishes and and a bunch of meh dishes could have earned 3 stars at 50 bucks a plate."
"We came here for dinner tonight after making a reservation a bit before our recent vacation out here. There's plenty of street parking around, but it may be a bit difficult to find a free spot - so it's probably best to use the valet parking, particularly if you're sitting down for the 10-course meal. Getting seated was a cinch, and the service throughout the meal is very good. You get an explanation of what each course is, your water and bread are diligently refilled, and the hostess gave us a very good suggestion for a fruity (but not too much so) white wine. My only complaint is that there was a longer wait than for other courses between the 7th and 8th courses, but aside from that, it was pretty standard service for a high-end restaurant.

All of the food was excellent, and with so many, I won't belabor the point walking through every dish. That said, the amuse bouche/appetizers at the beginning were fantastic. We had dungress crab coupled with some sort of gelatin and shaved ice that was amazing, as well as a poached egg topped with caviar and cream - that was an incredible combination as well. The caviar really enhanced the flavor of the egg, which wasn't as bold as you'd get in a poached egg at breakfast. The yellowtail with squid ink was a great combo as well - squid ink is something that I've only had in a pasta dish in the past, but this served to add depth to the flavor of the fish. Both the duck and the cochon de lait (young pork) were great as the meat dishes - the pork is extremely tender and savory, even without a marinade; the duck is smoky and has a creamy flavor to it as well. The cheese plate is small, but it was paired with a great jelly (I forget the name) and mulberries that really completed it. The gouda that was sliced thinly worked really well with it. Lastly, the chocolate and caramel dish worked really well together; it was sprinkled with something similar to Dippin' Dots that was caramel flavored, and the chocolate brownies were as rich as the small slice of chocolate ice cream that it was paired with.

The food here is great - it's definitely one of the best dinners I've had, and I'd love to come back. That said, I would like to highlight the one experience that I would dock half a star if Yelp did that in the individual ratings (but I still round up)...there is an option on the menu to get a signed version of the chef's cookbook for $35. The book itself is great, and doing a quick price-check on Amazon doesn't make the book seem that it's unfairly priced at that level. That said - we did NOT get our book signed. We saw the chef come out at least 3 times during our meal, and the hostess inquired multiple times if we had gotten it signed yet. Each time we said we hadn't, but by the time we had paid the bill and sat for a minute or two, there was still no sign that we would get it signed. It's a privilege to eat somewhere like here, so I didn't bother asking again before we left - it would be a bit awkward to sit at the table and wait, or to ask a waiter to get the chef's attention - but it's pretty poor form to use the chef's signature as an incentive (at least for some people, I am sure) to purchase the book and then to not have him sign it.

In short - buy the book for the content, but I wouldn't hold my breath if you want a signed copy, EVEN THOUGH the menu specifically says it will be signed. But come for the food nonetheless - it's fantastic.

Update: I ended up getting a call from Josiah Citrin a couple days later apologizing for overlooking the signing of the book. If you do happen to be in the area and your book wasn't signed at the table, it sounds like he is more than happy to arrange making sure the book gets signed. Unfortunately, I'm back in NY by now, but it's great to know that the folks at Melisse read this and gave me a call back!"
"Since I just got back from a week in Paris, I must admit, the bar has been set pretty high. I've been wanting to try Melisse for a while, and the Spring Discovery Menu was the perfect excuse - 4 courses Tues-Fri for $65.

I love the decor of the place - deep purple walls with lots of white orchids - both in paintings and in real vases. There's an area inside that has greenhouse-like ceilings overhead, which is pretty in the evening. There are also large white lanterns hanging from the walls.

The crowd was surprisingly young and grew to be louder as the night went on, so it didn't feel stuffy at all. However, when we were seated, we were not offered the discovery menu until we asked for it. Initial service was not condescending, per se, but maybe I read into it too much since I'm usually self conscious about being the youngest table. For some dishes, we received very haphazard explanations of the food, and I felt other diners got more attention.

The wine list is really extensive, with many bottles in the $40 range. Wines by the glass are relatively more expensive.

Our initial bite was a grape covered in goat cheese and chopped pistachios. The goat cheese was very fresh and strong, which provided a nice contrast to the juicy sweetness of the grape, and the pistachios were a nice crunch.

Next was the amuse bouche of salmon tartare with sundried tomato and a shooter of fennel flan and orange gelee. I think the amuse bouche was the highlight of my meal. The salmon was slightly smokey and nice in combination with the tangy tomato. The creaminess of the fennel flan was nicely contrasted by the clean citrus gelee underneath.

The bread selection is great, offering something for everyone. My personal favorite was the basil brioche, which was soft and flavorful, with a nice herb kick to it. It wasn't overly buttery, but warmed, it kind of melted in my mouth. The french bread was also nice and didn't even need butter. The bacon focaccia had large chunks of bacon in it, which was a bit much for me. The olive bread and ciabatta were also good.

I started with the beet salad, with varied cuts and colors of fresh beets, garnished with segmented citrus, chive oil, and fresh goat cheese. The highlight was the goat cheese, which was whipped and light. The whole dish was gorgeous in color, and it was light but satisfying. The other option for the first course was the mushroom ravioli, of which the filling melted in my mouth. The tough was soft and pillowy but not mushy at all.

Next was the option of salmon with portabello mushroom or Caledonian prawns. The salmon had an interesting thin crust to it and was just barely cooked, which made it extremely tender. I'm personally not a huge salmon fan, but texture-wise, it was done well. As for the prawns, they were large and de-shelled. The succotash of corn and chopped almonds and chantarelles was a good texture and flavor combination to offset the savory prawns. The prawns were definitely fresh, large, and naturally sweet. I think this was my favorite dish of the night.

For the main course, I had the halibut with fava bean. I was disappointed that the brown butter and wine sauce from the salmon dish was repeated over this fish dish. The sauce made it overly salty, and I'm not a huge fan of fava beans. The puree over it was nice with the fish, but the whole dish was unnecessarily buttery. The lamb option was cooked two ways, and it wasn't overly gamey. I enjoyed the more creative take on asparagus, which had one end crusted in cardamom and curry.

Desserts were disappointing. The passion fruit parfait with sorbet and coconut milk with mini tapioca reminded me of an Asian dessert that could be bought for $3-4 elsewhere. I enjoyed the flavors, but it didn't fit with the rest of the meal. The apple tartin was done well, with thinly sliced and baked apples, and it was a very precise and classic dish.

We ended with petit fours, of which the canele was perfectly carmelized. The ripe strawberries were super sweet and served with creme fraiche and rock sugar.

I wasn't amazed by the food, and I was a bit put off by the contrast in service between our table and the others around us. Service wasn't bad, but like I said, I felt others got more attention than we did. The highlights of the meal were the amuse bouche, the basil brioche, and canele in the petit four for me, which is unfortunate, considering none of them were items I specifically ordered. I shouldn't compare it to my experiences in Paris, but considering it's only been a week since I left France, it was hard for my meal to meet those standards."
"Atrocious service, arrogant staff, extremely mediocre food that wasn't worth even a quarter of the price I paid for it. PLEASE save your hard-earned dollars, and choose another of this city's wonderful dining establishments. I highly recommend Boa and Michael's."
"Melisse is my top favorite restaurant, and dining experience in all of LA. From walking in the door, the service was seemless and elegant. The Manager recommended the Spring Discovery Menu which is $65 for 4 courses! Not only the best deal in town, but the best food too! The timing of the courses, the tastes exploding in my mouth and the service was definitely worth going back for again and again, especially at that price.
Highly, highly, highly recommend it to everyone and I know I will keep going back for more!"
"Same same but different. I have so many amazing memories here and it was amazing to go back after all these years.

I love how the food has been modernized. We splurged on the truffles and it was so worth it.

Service was impeccable. I loved the small intimate room that overlooks the open kitchen. The record player was a nice touch.

The food was rich, decadent, and whimsical!

Change is good. What used to be a very formal dining experience is now a fun and quirky time!

Thanks for making it such a special night!"
"Dine LA 1/2017 review.

Excellent 'taste' of their regular menu (which can be overwhelming particularly if you get carte blanche).

Started with a delicious fresh meaty oyster. Luckily hubby doesn't like raw oysters so i got his too!

Next was a chestnut soup with whipped truffle: rich and warm, the truffle was not overpowering and perfect.

Followed by a truffle risotto ($50 supplement) with freshly shaved black truffles. The risotto was a tad under but the flavor was wonderful!

My prime beef rib eye was perfectly medium with a tender braised beef cheek.
To end the night was a orange vanilla yogurt & tapioca and petit fours.

Despite the seemingly small portions, we left feeling full and relaxed.

Though the pace of dishes were a bit slow, service was attentive."
"While taste and service were exceptional, portion sizes were woefully inconsistent. Invariably, each of the courses I chose were always larger than my husband's. Granted, some dishes are about packing flavor, not just size, but when my main entree (duck) ended up being twice as much as my husband's rib eye, it proved very unsatisfying for him. They really love purees and dotting your plate with various forms of foam and sauces. A bit overdone in my opinion, but perhaps you would enjoy it. In the end, our experience at Providence was much more fulfilling. I would not likely return to Melisse again if given the choice between the two. (Melisse's restroom is about the most disappointing restroom I have ever seen in a high end restaurant and clearly needs an upgrade.)"
"My 100th review is also on a restaurant where I spent the most money ever on a dinner!

I came to this place with coworkers for a social event. I had no idea what I was about to experience.

We sat down at this very cozy and elegant restuarant. Most of us dressed for the occassion while others wore jeans and got ""the eye"" from others. Nevertheless, the service at this place is superb. Well, for the price you pay it better be superb!

I think I spent over $100 on this 5 course event. Others spent about $150 because they ordered wine and cheese. But they do have a wide selection of wine and cheese! They had cheese I've never heard of or seen before. I was amazed!

Anyways, back to my French adventure....I really liked the fact that they had a small stool next to the ladies for their purses. I wish more restaurants had such a thing. It was a nifty idea!

The food was really good. But the preparation for the food took forever! I felt like we waited 30 minutes per entree that came out of the kitchen. It took us 3 hours to eat at this restaurant! So please be aware that eating at this fine establisment requires 3 hours of your time. They really value the eating experience and want you to relax and take your time to savour the foods.

It was my first time ever eating at a French restaurant and the first time to spend this much money!! But I guess it is fine dining afterall. It was definitely an experience I shall never forget. The time, money, atmosphere, and service I received was a real eating adventure for me that night."
"I've been to this place a few times over the past few years for special occasions and the tasting menu never disappoints! It's pricey, that's for sure-- but worth every hard-earned dollar.... highly recommend this place and certainly one of my top-10 faves in LA."
"Really enjoyed my dinner here. The portions for the 5 course tasting menu were deceptively HUGE and I ended up feeling like I needed to be rolled out. Great service, romantic atmosphere and even a little ""show"" when they kicked out a crazy lady and her poor date."
"My only Michelin meal in person for 2020. Overall I felt the set up outside was highly luxurious but most important safe. People were far enough apart where I felt completely comfortable. The food was fantastic as always and this was a nice treat for 2020 considering the circumstances.

My only tip is the tasting menu was kind of blah the night we went so I just coursed out my own 7 course meal. I know it's not typical in this type of restaurant but I've had too many Michelin tasting menus where half of the dishes are mediocre. Plus there was only 1 real tasting menu instead of 2-3 so don't be afraid to course out an single items. The waiter helped with the order etc.

The only other funny part was the chef/owner was eating at a table next to us and I got to watch 4-5 people go up to him and say hey! It's me Bruce! And every time except one, it was apparent the chef had no clue who the person was... very LA. The chef ordered 6 of the 7 dishes I ordered, so that made me confident I made good selections from the menu."
"You know the expensive restaurants in movies were people make fools of themselves? This feels like one of those places. I did however manage to behave myself
The service here was outstanding. The was constantly someone to come by ad take care of something for you. It's the kind of service that borders on over-bearing, but I think they pulled it off because I never actually felt uncomfortable. Maybe this could be described as an unpretentious, pretentious restaurant. I think everyone was well dressed, except for one guy. He was Richard Gear, so I guess it didn't matter.
Anyway, the real story is in the food. I always feel like when I come to a high- caliber place like this that I need to go with the chef's tasting menu. It doesn't really matter what I actually ordered because the menu itself changes fairly regularly, but it was spectacular. The ingredients are of course the very best, the presentation with artful, and the creations themselves were an experience.
In LA, this is a place that you must try at least once."
"Shockingly unpleasant in every way imaginable - from the decor (or lack thereof, and this is not a compliment in the modernist way), to the deliriously incompetent and robotic staff. End result was an evening filled with starvation residue and nausea, as exemplified concurrently by the gentleman puking in the bathroom upon my quick and voluntary removal from the premises. A drought, and uninspired atmosphere, poorly suited for any affair. Hampton Inn lobby style artwork and suitably generic accoutrement are the standard here. Prawns were barely suitable to be served, coated with an exasperatingly large amount of brittle and overbearing herb forestation. Maine lobster was an imposter, as clearly a dagastino lobster had made its way to die on my plate. With the bountiful harvest in Maine this year, hard to believe a supposed 5 star joint would find the need for such an banal misrepresentation. The steak which was represented by a 3 1/2 sliver of meat, presented a strange, foreign texture reminiscent of foie gras. The wait staff was nice, but jokingly undertrained. An obvious, and failed, effort by the staff leader to instruct with a head nod to her underlings to simultaneously service the table was laughter inducing at best. This is a dining disaster best left avoided."
"This place is absolutely beautiful on the inside! The elegant chandelier just sets the fine dining tone for the dining room. The easy going music in the background is at a perfect volume.

Not only does this place look nice but it also is ran very well. The waiters and waitresses are all extremely passionate and knowledgable about every single thing on the menu. Often you'll see 2 food runners for 2 people at one table which I think is unique because it feels like your being proposed a gift.

Now onto the food. Don't eat too much bread but please try the basil brioche if it's available!! The flavor profiles of each dish make perfect sense and chef Citrin makes them sing phenomenally from start to finish. The menu changes consistently with great success which shows the significant true passion of the chef. This was the best meal I've ever had from start to finish.

There were some things I don't agree with that brought me to 4 stars, but this is shear opinion. First off, I don't care what kind of water you're serving, there's no way water is ever worth 18 dollars! If you think there is...I personally think you're crazy. Second, I highly disagree with every cocktail being $20 that's absurd..especially since it's basically a 6oz drink!!! I did the 4 course meal which turned out to be a significant amount of food. I can't see anyone getting through the 10 course without boxing it up or leaving it. That's A LOT of food whether it's a small portion or not. The next thing I don't agree with is the supplement charges. If you're charging me 165 per person to start I don't see the need to add 65 dollar up-charges to just one dish. I understand that a 2 star Michelin restaurant is going to be expensive but there's got to be more practicality for me. Things shouldn't be expensive ""just because.""

So to sum it up you'll have a great memorable dining experience here, but if you're not filthy rich and still have some practicality about you then your wallet's gonna look like Swiss cheese after 2-3 hours if you're not extremely careful."
"I had the regular tasting menu which was fantastic. My waiter made great suggestions including the lobster bolognese, scallops, and sticky toffee pudding. I can't wait to starve myself so I can try the 10 item tasting menu (4 hours) without exploding. Next time..."
"Absolutely loved their food! They messed up with my reservation but managed to accommodate me, when they couldn't find my reservation in the system. Also, they brought little chocolate box for me upon asking but they didn't bring one for my hubby, which was quite surprising. Apparently, every table had that sweet box except our table.
Staff wasn't as friendly as you would find in Somni at SLS Hotel. Staff here was a little bit standoffish and not very warm and welcoming but I guess that is what they were going for."
"Thanks to Dine LA week I had the opportunity to stop by and try this amazing place. The menu for the event was about $130.00 PP which was reasonable because dinner at this place on the regular menu will cost you more. The service is excellent and the food is a must try. the ambiance was moderate, I did feel like we were rushed, we had reservations at 9: 15 pm and finished eating before 9:45 pm For the price we paid I wanted to enjoy the dinner a little longer. Parking is tough, Valet is a must. I will be back soon."
"Miserable Michelin experience.
Everything went well except for the course plan. I ordered the 10 for my family, yet my mom and I got fed up by the Foie Gras which just the 4th course. After the 5th dish, we had completely lost our appetite. We hardly enjoyed the aged duck the prime steak or even the truffle risotto. When we finally finished all 10 courses, my mom and I nearly went to throw up..
Our waiter could've stopped us from ordering the 10 just by looking at our body type or by telling us how filling the food would be, but unfortunately he didn't say a thing besides being super happy about overselling. And because of that, we barely enjoyed anything after the 4th course.
""We were paying for suffering."" - from my mom after dinner. Sadly that was so true for us."
"Unbelievably delicious!!! Very french in the ""timing"" aka plan on being there for a lllong meal.

The amuse bouch were fun. Loved the caviar, but I didn't like the fennel flaun much. The trey of assorted fresh baked rolls are making my mouth water to think about, but they were cold and should have been warm. They had a pesto roll, bacon roll, kalamata olive roll, ciabbata roll, etc.

It is very expensive, but very yummy.

My meal:
Appetizer: kobi beef tartar- $45
Main: Truffle Crusted Dover Sole with hand made potato gnocchi, baby spinach and mushrooms- $55
Dessert: Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate! (a variety of small delicious hand made creative chocolate desserts including a warm gooey souffle)- $35
Tauni Port- delicious!!

Experience at Melisse- highly reccomended!"
"Melisse is by far my favorite restaurant of all time. It's definitely pricy but it makes it worth it every single time.
The restaurant specializes in pre-fix menus. It often has an additional truffle option for one of the dishes.
The service is beyond exquisite. We try to get a booth instead of the table in advance so that we have more privacy. But any seat you get, you'll be happy.
They often have the specific chef who worked on creating your dish come out, introduce herself and talk about the dish. If one of the servers leaves while you're still present, it's done seamlessly and someone takes over without making the big deal about it.
We've never spent less that 2.5 hours here so expect it to be long, and beautiful, night.
The wine pairing is costly but amazing as well. We rarely get it since neither my boyfriend or I are into drinking more than a glass of wine.
All the dishes are amazing, but I'll put the spotlight on EGG CAVIAR (Soft Poached Egg, Smoked Trout, Lemon Cr√®me Fra√éche, Sturgeon Caviar)... DELICIOUS!"
"I've been to Melisse twice and had an amazing experience both times. On my first visit, I arrived early and was sitting in the foyer sipping a drink when a gentleman stepped out of the kitchen and started talking to me in a friendly way. Turns out it was the chef Josiah Citrin ! Such a down-to-earth and funny man....I didn't find out he was the chef until after the meal but this was a great way to start the evening.

To sum up, the food was outstanding. Delicious. Creative. Amazing. What always astonishes me at restaurants like this is that the portions seem so small, yet by the end of the evening, you're totally stuffed to the gills. I guess it's quality, not quantity, that counts.

The atmosphere is fantastic too. Quiet but not stuffy. The staff are helpful and knowledgeable but not snobby. The decor is soothing, classy and does not distract from the food.

The menu changes but one constant is the dessert that I cannot fail to mention: Chocolate, Chocolate, Chocolate. A MUST for all chocolate fans (and for non-chocolate fans, you strange beings from another planet....!)

This would be a great restaurant for special occasions. Parking is available on the streets of Santa Monica (check signs for meter expiration times to avoid an unpleasant end to a fabulous evening.)"
"the food presentation palate is the greatest, well deserve of michellin stars, and the service is very very proper, i never been treated better. except the wine serving could use little help on the etiquette but overall this is a very good experience to dine there."
"What a memorable dinner! We were here to celebrate 4 long and grueling years together, upon arriving to our booth there was a lovely little setup with truffles and a placard that read 'Happy Anniversary'. The staff is top notch, knowledgeable, approachable. The restaurant has 2 Michelin stars for a reason, there are flavors here that cannot be replicated elsewhere in the city, service is impeccable and everything is plated beautifully.

The bf and I had the 8 course tasting, took about 3-4 hours (we closed out the restaurant). All in all, with the supplemental fromage, egg caviar, and espresso at the end our bill totalled to about $450-$500. Well worth it!

I am glad our reservation was for a Friday night, there was life in the restaurant. Everyone seemed to be enjoying their evening as much as we were.


Here is a list of dishes that my other half and I especially enjoyed:

Clam and tomato/cucumber gazpacho (amuse-bouche)
Egg Caviar
Lobster Bolognese
Flat Iron Steak
Passion Fruit (dessert item)
Chocolate, Chocolate, Chocolate (dessert item)
Basil brioche (from the bread selection)

Another tip: If you are full at the end, which you will be, you can always ask for your petit four to be boxed up for takeout. It will be provided at the end, compliments of the restaurant."
"I can't write anything that hasn't been written. Food was great, service great. Expensive, but worth it for special occasions. Went for anniversary and everyone wished us a happy birthday.

How someone could not rate this a 5 is inconceivable. Can't wait to go back."
"Guess what - IT'S NOT THAT EXPENSIVE ANYMORE

Went last night with two friends and we all had the anniversary menu - 4 courses for $65, wine pairings $110. The regular set menu is $105, and the anniversary menu has (probably) some of the best choices from the set menu (especially the beef dish - tasty and conceptually solid), and for about the same price, you can enjoy the same amount of food PLUS great wine. As of now, the courses are:

(Amuse bouche) - with wine pairing

Lobster bolognese - with wine pairing

Halibut - with wine pairing

Prime Beef Strip Sirloin - with wine pairing

Passion fruit parfait - NO pairing

Kind of odd that they wouldn't do a dessert wine pairing, but when they accidentally kept our food waiting on two of the courses (and we had already finished the wine, thinking it was for the previous dish), they brought us a NEW wine on one occasion, and re-filled our glasses on a separate occasion.

Per the maitre d', we also added a course of Foie Gras Terrine which was phenomenal. I usually prefer seared fg over terrine, but this just had the perfect consistency and worked well with the berry compote and toast (which reminded me of awesome Sizzler texas toast) that both accompanied.

Really great service and a REALLY great deal - highly recommend it."
"It is probably inevitable that you compare the top two restaurants in LA (Melisse and Providence). Between the two, Melisse had the highest-highs, but also the lowest-lows. For that reason, I would choose Providence first BUT my girlfriend would disagree with me. Either way, you cannot go wrong.

We had a 10-course tasting menu with an addition of cote de bouf. On the tasting menu, the snapper was excellent, and the salmon was great. The breads are fantastic. The cavier-egg with a ""toast"" (which I'm pretty sure is pure butter held together loosely by flour) was delicious. All of the desserts and petitfours were fantastic, particularly the lemon verbena ice cream with berries.

The cote de beouf was one of the absolute best things I have ever eaten in my life.

However, the scallop dish on the tasting menu was one of the most disappointing. I absolutely love scallops and for a restaurant of Melisse's caliber I expect perfection, and this did not deliver. In fact, I did not even want to finish the dish -- *sigh*. The clam dish was also just so-so and a bit bland, in my opinion.

Due to the scallop badness I was tempted to give Melisse only 4 stars. Our staff, however, was simply too gracious and the rest of the meal too good for me to dock a star. Our server surprised us by not charging us extra for the cote de beouf addition, and I am pretty sure we got a few extras on the desert/petitfour front. He and the rest of the staff were extraordinary and they really did make us feel welcome and pampered.

I will be back one day!"
"Melisse. One of the most expensive restaurants in Los Angeles. (far from one of the best)

To be fare, it's not bad. if it were $20 per person with wine, I'd give it five stars. But having been flat broke in my life, I expect amazing, delicious, original, romantic, decadent, sumptuous and beautiful from a place that charges you the equivalent of airfare to an exotic place.

I can think dozens of restaurants that are superior at a fraction of the cost. I've dined at the best restaurants in Paris so it baffles the mind how this restaurant can presume to contend with fine French haute cuisine and get away with charging even more for it.

I've dined here for work events and birthday parties. My colleagues are fond of the Scotch selection and their wives are happy to have tried the expensive Melisse. But no one has ever stopped talking for having been shushed by the food. No one has ever offered my a taste of their dinner proclaiming what should be proclaimed for the price tag here, ""You HAVE to try this!""

Why do people try new restaurants on their birthdays? Buy a ticket to Paris instead. Come back and spit at the chef of this restaurant for having duped you.

It is not the best nor the worst food that I've ever had but it might be the most boring and it is sincerely the most overrated restaurant that I have ever been in my entire time as a resident of this planet.

To all of us who make the pilgrimage to France regularly, this place is a joke. The service is lovely, the room is dull but that joie de vive that you expect from one of those sell a kidney to pay for it restaurants is sorely lacking.

what have I eaten here? Ugh, I don't even remember and neither does anyone I've dined with. It is has always been the same the few times that we have tried it, totally forgettable."
"My first impression of Melisse was not very positive. Given that the employees located at the hostess station are the ones first representing their place of work, I'm used to being greeted warmly and with a smile. However, I recall walking through the door to scowls and an uncomfortable atmosphere. After giving our name for the reservation the hostess quite literally barked ""THIS WAY"" to guide us to our table. I turned to look at my friends to see if I had misheard her, but by the looks on their faces, I did not.
We each chose the 7 course with wine pairing. I highly recommend the veal rib eye, it was probably my favorite thing on the menu along with the egg caviar. If you have a small appetite don't hesitate to pick the 4 course. Expect to spend at least two hours here no matter what course you pick.
Our sommelier was probably one of the best parts of our experience (along with the food of course). He was a lovely fellow who was extremely enthusiastic and knowledgeable of what he was presenting. I was also impressed that the chef came to each table and asked everyone about their meal. Making a meal personal goes a long way for someone like me. Our server also did very well, however I never received a stool for my purse. I noticed that every other guest with a bag received one. I also noticed that my table had the youngest guests in the establishment at the time. Do these two things correlate? I'll never know...
I'm always overcritical of an establishments choice of interior design, so I wasn't very impressed with their ""style"". However, I think most people would agree that they could use an update. It looks like someone just threw a few nice things together with purple walls and said that's good enough! Also, i'm still confused about the paper weight looking glass piece in the middle of each table...
I genuinely wish that I could give this restaurant four or five stars and I would if it was based purely on the food, chef, and sommelier. Sadly, I had to take account of the unfriendly hostess and lackluster interior design."

"Late post. Ate there a few years back for Dine LA. The place lives up to the hype. Added shaved truffles when offered and they shaved the truffles at the table and was the most generous truffle addition I've ever experienced. The best part was the Sommelier ... he was a really young guy who knew more about wine than google and didn't make you feel any less for having no idea about the wines he offered.... and all were amazing. Obviously a high end experience will be a higher end check, but for a treat is recommend it."
"Wonderful atmosphere. The GM made all of the right recommendations. Who would think to get a chicken dish at a french restaurant??? It was recommended to us, and it is the best chicken I have EVER had!!!

I love Melisse and go there every time I come into town.

Merci"
"Celebrated my birthday at Melisse and it was exceptional. Our dinner was amazing! Each dish was beautiful and the flavors were delicious. The service was flawless. I am sorry that it took us so long to visit Melisse, but we will return soon. The staff was welcoming and made us feel right at home. The dining room was full and there were all types of people enjoying their dinner; young and old, casual and fancy. A superb experience from start to finish - if I could give them 6 stars I would! Thank you for a lovely night."
"The finest dining experience in all of California! The ma√Ætre d' and head waiter are absolutely amazing. It is very clear that everyone who works here wants to be here and has a tremendous passion for food and the accompanying alcohol they are serving.

The four course option is perfect, there's no way we could've finished a seven course meal! We highly recommend you add a cheese tray to our four courses ;so technically it will be 5 courses!

Make sure you and the other diner order exact opposite things that way you will have double the variety of foods. Do not miss the lobster bolognese...absolute heaven!!

They will make the drinks to order, with your preferences. The bartender made me a lychee martini called a Larise, which was again one of the finest drinks I have ever had!

This is a high-priced fine dining experience perfect for those special occasions. Make certain to highlight the celebration you are having so that the whole restaurant will acknowledge your birthday, anniversary, holiday, etc.

C'est magnifique!"
"Had a lovely dining experience here on the Valentine's day. The outdoor atmosphere was romantic with lights and all, and the food was, as expected, great. The pea soup with truffle mousse was my favorite. Overall, there was no disappoints nor surprises that ""wow""ed us."
"I wanted to visit a two star michelin rated restaurant, so I went here. Probably one of the best choices I've ever made.

Service: Amazing. There's no other word for it. All the food comes out at the same time, and there's a guy there who will tell you exactly what you're eating. he explains everything and its all very nice. The waiter was also great. He'll give you tips about what you should get, and what order you should eat them in. The best deal is definitely the five course dinner. The best part is you can substitute anything you want for any course( but if you get the truffles, don't expect to pay the same price ).

Food: Perfection. I thought Gordon Ramsey was good. This guy blows Ramsey out of the water. The Kobe beef filet mignon was the most tender piece of beef I've ever had. It melt like butter in my mouth( ok, that probably doesn't sound that good, but trust me, if you can afford it, get it ). Its really hard to explain just how great this place is. This is the pinnacle of cooking. I really don't understand how a restaurant could be better ( I guess I'll just have to visit a 3 star michelin restaurant now... )

Prices: Exorbitant. Truffle dishes run at $150 if I remember right. The kobe is an extra $90 or so on top of the base price for the tasting menu. Cavair can run you an extra $200 too. I didn't look at the wine list, but I'm sure they got some pretty expensive wines on there too. In spite of this however, I still have to say that it is worth every penny.

Overall Verdict: A must for anyone who loves food."
"Wow...that about sums up the dinner at Melisse. I was a little disappointed at the no pictures policy because the food looked as great as it tasted...a group picture was allowed at the end of the dinner and apparently they've had a problem of people constantly taking flash pics of each course which bacame an annoyance for other diners...understandable. Melisse has 2 coveted Michelin stars but still manages to have a more casual upscale atmosphere. The menus are all prix-fix selections as they no longer serve a-la-carte...you choose between a four or ten course dinner or the top of the line carte-blanche menu in which the owner/chef will customize a menu just for you and your party, can we say $$$$..personally, I recommend the 10 course tasting menu because of the variety of dishes you get to sample and it's only $25 more than the 4 course. Check out their website and you'll see pics and descriptions of the dishes. I was never a big fan of Caviar, but the caviar they served on top of this egg was amazing, the pasta with the truffle foam was great and so on and so on. The menu does change slightly from week to week so just be aware of it. We actually had a little surprise because our 10 course actually ends up being 12 courses (2 extra dishes for free). Each dish, was so packed with balanced flavors that you just feel somehow satisfied with every dish. Be prepared to set aside a few hours for dining though as it does take time..but it's well worth it..unless your idea of a good meal is the local buffet. Can't wait to go back."
"My family took me out to Melisse for my birthday and it was a great meal, though I wasn't as impressed as I was looking to be. The place is elegant and the service is impeccable, and I suspect that the second Michelin star was earned on this basis alone. For the money, you can do better on food.

But this is not to say the food wasn't delicious. Our party of seven went with the tasting option, so the birthday girl had her fork in several different things, most of which pleased her.

There were three amuse bouches - red grape coated with goat cheese and pistachio, house-cured salmon with capers, pickled daikon, and yuzu, and a shotglass layered with orange gelee, fennel flan, and cashew foam with vanilla oil. All three were fun, flavorful little bites. There was a nice selection of bread as well. The brioches were the best, both the aromatic basil and the regular pillowy white. The olive bread and French roll were great, too, and I would've enjoyed the bacon bread had I not been exposed to the superior version at Providence.

For my four courses, I ordered the lobster bolognese, the truffle crusted Dover sole fillet, the Liberty Farms duck breast and confit, and the sticky toffee pudding. The first two were somewhat disappointing. While the lobster bolognese was good, with fresh cappelini, black truffles, basil, and brown butter foam, it wasn't as amazing as it should've been given that ingredient list. The sole, which came with a $10 supplement, was the blandest dish of the night. The fillet rested on a stew of potato gnocchi, king oyster mushrooms, spinach, and what I assume was jus de cuisson truffee. Everything was cooked well, but the whole didn't shine. The duck, on the other hand, was awesome. The duck itself was very tender, with a healthy layer of fat in each bite. It was served with some fantastic lentils du poy as well as turnip and red ruby grapefruit and a turnip-grapefruit sauce. The toffee pudding dessert with mocha malt ice cream and red berries-hibiscus consomme was another winner. The pudding was very sticky and very thick in a very good way.

I of course sampled everyone else's food throughout the meal and there were some other highlights as well. The egg caviar with poached egg, lemon-chive creme fraiche, and American Osetra caviar was very good, a merry meeting of salt and tart and sweet. I don't know if it was worth a $20 supplement, but it was definitely delicious. The prosciutto wrapped monkfish was another great dish, with nice firm chunks of monkfish served with maitake mushrooms, celtuce, and a mustard sabayon. My brother ordered the roasted jidori chicken with artichokes, Spanish onions, and orange-infused chicken jus off the a la carte menu, and this was surprisingly good, moist chicken. Of the desserts, I thought the clotted cream cheese cake with spiced pumpkin ice cream, caramelized pumpkin, and vanilla-honey sauce was wonderful, as was the peanut-butter chocolate tart in the ""Chocolate, Chocolate, Chocolate"" dessert.

I don't think I had anything bad at Melisse. In fact everything was at least good. In addition to what I've already listed, I tried the Japanese hamachi, the Maine and Hokkaido scallops, the roasted venison loin, and the duo of prime short rib, as well as the caramelized pineapple and the rest of the chocolate dessert. All of these were quite nice, served in thoughtful, artful presentations. The problem, I guess, is that none of them were memorable. I'm definitely glad I tried Melisse and wouldn't think to give it less than 4 stars, but I would never go on my own dime.

If you value formality and spider sense in service, though, Melisse has you covered there. My little brother broke a wine glass and was instantly swarmed by waiters who seemed more apologetic than annoyed. Each course was presented with flair, and I love a restaurant that starts with amuse bouches and ends with mignardises. Ours were caneles and strawberries. The doughy chewy custard-filled caneles were actually not good. The tiny strawberries with creme fraiche and demerara sugar, on the other hand, were superb. For my birthday, I was also gifted with delicious dark chocolates in a box that I enjoyed the next day.

So overall, Melisse was a great experience and a great restaurant. If it were at a less astonishing price point, I would probably be less hesitant to heap on praises. The fact is, though, that you can get more delicious food at more reasonable restaurants that still classify as fine dining. For what they charge, Melisse should have blown me away, and I can say I stayed grounded throughout the majority of my meal."
"$7.50 for filtered tap water says it all. An overpriced disappointment, the lobster bolognese the lobster went missing and the halibut was a taste not an entree. Hoped to enjoy a long awaited restaurant return as the pandemic winds down only to feel that this wasn't it."
Flat out the best restaurant in Los Angeles! As an old native I can't even tell you what's in second place! I've been coming here since it's opened and have never been disappointed! It's certainly not for everyone but I encourage to break open the piggy bank and try it!
"Jiraffe, a restaurant nearby, is better, friendlier, and not obnoxious; especially if I'm spending $250.00. The food was ok, but not something to recall. Too much salt. Too many south of border chefs, I think. Top chef should phone home.

We will not go back to Melisse."
"Sweet baby Jesus. OK, first things first - you can't think about money. You just have to order and be ok with spending at least $200/person. Spot on service and quite possibly the best meal of my life. I somehow think the negative nancies out there in the yelpiverse must have their panties in a wad or unrealistic expectations. Honestly, I'm pretty picky about food, service and ambiance and I thought the evening was amazing. Had the 10 + wine pairings (worth the extra $$). Was SO full by the time we left, but had a blast."
"My partner and I made booking to eat here on our holiday from Australia back in November, ccelebrating our engagement.

Our primary server was fantastic. Attentive, polite, without being intrusive throughout the meal. He spoke with us about what we wanted for a wine, and really helped find one that satisfied both of our pallets, despite us having slightly different likes when it comes to wine.

We had the Carte Blanche Menu, knowing we were in for an experience as well as a meal.

We mentioned how we had tried a delicious truffle dish elsewhere the night before, and he brought us an extra course from the chef made for us, a truffle risotto.

At the end of the night, he brought us a signed message from the chef, on the wine label that he had steamed off the bottle and laminated for us to remember the night.

Every dish was creative, and delicious.

The night made a good dent on the credit card, but we had no regrets about going. It's one of the memories from a great holiday that we will talk about for the rest of our lives."
"for the past 10+ years, whenever anyone asked me what my favorite restaurant in LA is, without hesitation, the word rolled quickly and easily off my tongue: melisse. the food was exquisite; the service even better; and the experience left you pining for your next there. and, without a doubt, you always felt like it was worth very cent of that $500+ you just spent. i've referred countless out of town guests there through the years and, if i had reviewed melisse a month ago before my most recent experience, i would have given it 6 stars out of 5.

it's amazing how one bad server can mar a long-standing opinion of this place. we went on friday night and, as usual, ordered a tasting menu with wine pairings. our server was a cute, young girl who was professional enough and sufficiently friendly. but the entire time, we felt like like we were being nickel and dimed, which was something that has never happened before at melisse. we ordered the wine pairing for $75 each, which while it's not a full glass of wine with each course is a sizeable enough pour that's enough to complement your food. when the sommelier poured our wine pairing, it was healthy and of a sufficient quantity. however, when our server poured the wine, it was tiny and even smaller than tastings that you'd get a winery or tasting room. we couldn't help but laugh after one pour that was more than half gone after i took once sip (and i'm a slow drinker who can get through a 3 course meal with 1.5 glasses of wine total).

we were full by the end, but couldn't pass up the cheese course. melisse has one of the best cheese carts in LA. so we decided to share 1 order of cheese. the server took such care to sliver the cheese as thinly as possible (think thinner than pre-sliced cheese that you buy at the store, and a heck of a lot smaller) and to give us the tiniest serving humanly possible. frankly, we didn't need more food, but by this point, we were so appalled by her nickel and diming that we were more attentive to the issue. we've shared a single cheese plate many times in the past at melisse, and they've always been more substantial.

after the food, wine, various optional add-ons (i.e., whole sole served tableside, cheese course), and tip, our bill all told was around $550. we left feeling a huge sense of dissatisfaction from the chintzy treatment we had gotten all night and somewhat annoyed that we were forced to tip the waitress who was the source of this aggravation $100. (we would have left her less than 20%, but we didn't want to deny the rest of the very good staff who were likely sharing in the gratuity.) but i can tell you that we're certainly not pining for our next experience there.

melisse, if you're reading this right now, just remember that we're happy to walk out of your restaurant with our pocketbooks significantly lighter so long as we feel like it was worth every cent. having your servers be stingy to save about $8 worth of wine and $2 in cheese is a small cost-savings that will surely cost you in the long run when we don't come running back anytime soon."
"My family and I first started eating at Jiraffe and followed Josiah here. We always feel warm and welcomed when we come as he always walks the room and greets his guests. Food and staff are always amazing. We've had great memories here.

The experience is always magical."
"5/5 for quality of food and service!
My wife and I had the 4 course meal. I believe the quantity of food you get with the 4 course (larger portions)compared with the 10 course is comparable.

We paid an extra $35 for the 2lb rib eye supplement which was totally worth it!!"
"The food is delicious and pretty. You can add truffles with your order. It's very nice chivies came to introduce every courses for you. Why I use ""chivies"", because the courses made by different chivies. They all will come to introduce how they made it for you one by one."
Great ambience and great food. Top notch service. Definitely recommend it for one of a kind experience. It was my wife's birthday and we went with tasting menu but it's not really tasting. It's full course menu with generous amount of food. I couldn't eat more because I was full so much. It's definitely worth the money. Only disadvantage which was funny for me that they charge $7.50 for bottle of tap water. It was unnecessary when you know table of two will drop at least $500 for dinner. Other than this 5 star all the way.
"While I'm not completely sold on the atmosphere, which is a bit stuffy and old-fashioned with it's somewhat 80's decor, the food is wonderfully executed and the service is about as good as it gets. I have a love/hate relationship with the mix and match nature of the prix-fixe oriented menu, as it allows for breathing room at a great cost.

Tagliatelle with lobster bolognese and truffle foam is phenomenally delicous. Other stand-outs are the venison, ice cream, cheese selections, and wine menu.

Terrific place for a splurge"
"Could someone tell me what's the name for their basil bread? I loved it and have been thinking about it for two days. Good food, very typical fine-dining restaurant food, 5 starts without price consideration and 4 with price. The desserts(we had mont-blanc and the strawberry thing) were not very impressive but the basil bread made up for that.
Nice place but there are no windows, perhaps making it more intimate? Staff are nice but busy.
There's an item on the bill called ""healthcare"", which we were confused and later found out that it was a surcharge for certain political Act.... makes me a little uncomfortable because I simply don't believe in this. And you think adding ~$20 to the bill would have smaller disutility effect just because the bill is already several hundreds?"
"Lovely. Great food, quality ingredients. Creative enough to make you look but not so ""cutting edge"" that things start to get weird.

The amuse bouche of Prawn was one of my favorites. The prawn is so sweet and tender, and I love the panna cotta.
The first course of Yellowtail Hamachi is stunning, wrapped in ripe avocado.
Pay the extra for Egg Caviar - you'll never regret keluga. The underneath egg is poached so soft you might think it's just cream.
Even the bread is memorable. The green of the Basil Brioche isn't a gimmick - you really are eating a field of basil. 
If you're going to get the risotto, try the Vongole Crusted Alaskan Halibut first. This fish is a more delicate flavor compared to a bowl of butter, truffle, and cheese.
That said, the Truffle Lobster Risotto is a supplement worth paying for. They know how to make a risotto with a firm but tender rice, and they use Aged Acquerello Rice which is supposed to be the best in the business. And they shave those white truffles with a heavy hand.
SRF Wagyu Beef Sirloin. It's a meatier cut than most wagyu I've had, requiring a bit more chew, but more beefy in flavor as well. A gravy-esque bone marrow sauce is like meat-caramel, and the short rib wrapped in pasta tastes as pretty as it looks.  
I liked the wagyu but I liked the Truffle Stuffed Sonoma Lamb Loin more. This lamb just melts in the mouth. Squash flowers are folded with juicy rib meat, and the charred eggplant really smolders.

A creamy Raspberry Bavaroise to finish, pairs great with a glass of sweet rose.

They call healthcare workers heroes, but it's the servers who are the saints. They already put up with so much, and now we've added a deadly pandemic to the list of things they must endure. Aside from seeing the obvious face masks and shields, I really don't see the difference. The service is no less meticulous and no less professional. The staff are polite but also genuinely enthusiastic, and they really haven't slacked. Great service, beautiful patio set-up, and overall such a nice break from post-pandemic life!"
"YELP INSIDER TIP FROM DOREEN (AKA AZN PERSUASION): Chef/Owner Josiah Citrin is opening a new casual restaurant in Sept on Washington and Via Dolce called Charcoal. It will have his smoked rib dish which was on the $85 dinela menu, but is not a feature on the regular menu. He walked around a little and spoke to a couple tables so we were lucky enough to meet him, very nice down to earth guy. AMAZING FOOD!

*****

Dinela is in full swing and this year my friends and I are going big. We've scheduled it so all the $85 places are first. Earlier was Spago, and tonite was Melisse. Next will be Patina, then Bestia (tho not dinela), then Bazaar, Hamasaku, Yojisan and maybe Fogo de Chao. As good as Spago was, Melisse of course blew it out of the water and $85 at Melisse was a STEAL. They have a sign that says no cell phones or flash photography so I would take pix on the sly so only a couple courses are shown. The bread they had was unbelievably good. They come around with a tray of 7-8 types of bread. We both chose the basil one and the bacon focaccia. The basil one was soft and good alone, you add butter and it was out of this world. The butter by itself is good. The bacon focaccia had a nice crust too. The first bread was my fave. The complimentary amuse bouche was a purple jellied grape and a green grape with cheese and pistachios. Liked the 2nd one better, but they both may have tasted better if served chilled vs room temp. The 2 oysters came with pomegranate foam
and cocoa nibs, sounds odd, but it works. I like my food simple, but I really liked all of the dishes here. I chose the sweet onion parm soup which is served hot table side. It came with a round crab cake which had a hint of anise or something and some julienne greens, not sure what. They tell you to mix it all together. The soup was so good I could have done w/o the other stuff. It's a little rich and a small serving made me really full. My friend got the beef tartare which was also good. All raw beef topped with rice puffs. The cod was cooked to perfection. The top had an air of citrus and the flavors separately and combined flowed well together. The more I ate the better it tasted. At first I thought it was a tad sweet, but with each bite the dish continued to grow on me. The grilled smoked ribs were by far the best dish. Chef Josiah says it takes so long to prepare and perfect he put it on the dinela menu because be could commit to serving it for 10 days and could know how much to order/prep vs putting it on the daily menu. Dessert was very coffee and chocolate heavy. My fave were the coffee panna cotta blobs and dollop of pudding. The coffee flavor was very strong in the ice cream and other desserts. Lastly, they serve 7 petit fours to every person at the table complimentary. It came with choco chip cookie, green tea macaroon, French cake thing which neither of us liked, choco ganache, grape jelly candy, and fresh mango piece. My friend did the wine pairing so that's the wine list you see. Service is excellent and top notch, the restaurant is open, spacious, and modern. They have coat check and stool for your purse. It was warm in there and the waiters are very pleasing to the eye. The bathroom is very ugly considering the decor, menu, price, and ambiance of the rest of the place. Def can't wait to go back and try Charcoal."
"We went there for my friend's birthday dinner. I liked the fact that they had a cute happy birthsay sign on the table with little box of truffle for my friend. We had the 10 course meal which all was excellent except the wild Scottish red partridge dish as I am not a huge fan of gamey meat. Their truffle was very flavorful with beautiful plating. My favorite was actually the very last dessert, Mutsu GREEN Apple which was very refreshing. The service was also excellent. Overall this was was a very pleasant dining experience."
"Food was awesome. You're not going to taste anything close to the level that Melisse is at. I really enjoyed everything about the food.
The waiters/waitresses were really nice and knowledgeable about the menu.
My only gripe was that we were here for my wife's birthday and were having a great time but they seemed to have forgotten about our table for the entree. We sat there for at least 45 minutes just waiting and finally called the waitress over and asked how much longer we had to wait. She said she had just checked and it would be right out, but it took at least another 15-20 minutes after that. I think they must have forgotten about us, and it didn't really seem to bother them. Given that the meal came out to almost $200/person after tax and tip, I was a bit disappointed."
"The outside is non-descript. The interior lives up to expectations. We started with the foie gras and caviar. Both were melt in your mouth good. The lobster bolognese was not to my liking visually or by taste. The mushroom ravioli was a rich delight. The creme brulee was typical and nothing I haven't had before...but the cookie-ish item that topped it made it a better dessert. The service was excellent. And there was parking on the street...and valet was available. Reservations were easy to make. The restaurant was almost 2/3rds empty...due I'm guessing to the recession. It is a really pricey restaurant. My jaw dropped when I saw the bill. Was the dollop of caviar worth $45?...it was the best caviar I've ever had...but no, I wouldn't normally spend that kind of money for it."
"My new favorite LA place... food sublime and the service wonderful! the service is what really pushed this to 5 stars. so often at a place like Melisse you can get attitude with your meal, here they were gracious, sense of humor and fun. Well done and can't wait to go back!"
Best meal I will probably ever have in my life. Served by the absolutely best waiter who seemed more like a tour guide through a gastronomical journey. The restaurant was much more expensive then we usually experience but worth every penny. Kudos to the chef--a true artist. We stumbled on this restaurant after taking our college student daughter to Universal Studios and we probably weren't dressed for the occasion but we were made to feel completely welcome and treated like royalty. Highly recommended for a special occasion.
"Great atmosphere, spectacular presentation, very attentive servers. Very exclusive and private experience. Only total of 5 tables(2 people each table for total of 10 people). Interesting wine pairing. Have to warn you though, it was 14 courses meal, prepare your stomach for this feast! I ended up not eating the lamb course because personally not a fan of lamb. 70% of the meals are sea food based and they would not accommodate if you have shell fish allergy. It is very pricey meal though. It was around $2000 for a party of 2."
"Sadly I cannot dine in Michelin restaurants every night... but I am so glad that I travelled to the west side to experience Melisse. Fantastic service, amazing wines, attention to detail. It is impossible to pick a favorite dish... we selected options from the regular menu as there were three of us allowing a greater selection to share and sample. I would definitely recommend some of the ""upgrade"" dishes that require a supplement. Do expect to drop some cash, maybe slightly more than this experience should actually be worth."
"A friend of ours raved about Melisse and we thought it about time to dine there. The room is nicely appointed, but might need a update. (especially the bathrooms). We enjoyed a very attentive waitstaff and an explanation of each course, wonderful waiter. (James, I think). The portions are very tiny and extremely overpriced for the quality and size.The flat Iron steak wasn't different than any other restaurant for allot less. The tiny lamb was soft, but tasteless; even with the small tots of sauces on the plate. The fish was uneventful. We arrived at 7:30 and left at 9:50.....it was a bit too long. The dessert was delicious......had the chocolate x3. So after spending $400 for two people....we will not be going to Melisse again. Over-rated and over-priced. Disappointed......:("
"After reading all the Yelp reviews and taking into consideration the TWO Michelin stars that Melisse has, I was expecting a complete, solid, flawless meal. Unfortunately, there were some bumps in the road....

First, a list of the positives:

*great service from servers - attentive and friendly

*two amuse bouches (1. grapes two ways and 2. salmon) were some of the tasty ab's ever!

*selection of bread was fantastic - brioche and country french rolls were favs

Now, the negatives that prevented me from giving my five stars:

*food was overly salted!!

*short ribs were too salty and the steak on the same plate was tough and without flavor - what??

*sommelier was not the friendliest or most helpful guy ever...

So there it is...good to try once but next time, maybe Providence?"
"Melisse was the perfect choice for my Valentine's Day dinner.

We got a table for the special Valentine's Day tasting menu and we were blown away by the food, the service and the ambience of the place.

The tables were set up around a central visual display of red roses, pink roses, carnations and the like. Each table had a tasteful candle and an orchid inside a bowl of water.

When we got to the table, there was a small black box of truffles waiting for us wrapped with a silver ribbon.

Our first course had two grapes, one wrapped in goat cheese and pistachio and the other in strawberry. Then we each got a complimentary naked cowboy oyster served on a bed of sea shells. The presentation was remarkable.

For my first course I got the egg caviar soft poached egg with lemon creme fraiche. It was a gastronomical delight. The other option was the New Zealand tai snapper which was also good but nothing compared to the caviar.

The second course I opted for the foie gras but I wish I got the truffle soup instead. The foie gras was caked in a blood orange paste and it really overpowered it. The soup was out of this world though!

The next dish was the Stonington Maine diver scallop. This was so tender and the truffle pur√©e was so perfectly paired that I almost took my girlfriends portion.

The fourth dish was a black bass ""en ecailles"" meaning it had scales. This offered a unique crunch that I had never tried before. Definitely eye opening.

The fifth dish was a choice between steak or lamb. I had the Sonoma lamb. It was accompanied by a jus d'agnue. This was amazing though I feel the consensus afterwards was that the lamb was too small. The dry aged New York steak provided a more generous portion.

To top off the meal, we shared a chocolate mound cake with earl grey and caramel and then strawberry rhubarb with vanilla and yogurt.

All in all the meal was extremely extravagant and luxurious and the price definitely reflected this. But at the end of the day who can put a price on a happy Valentine's Day? I would most definitely go again."
"5 hours of dinning pleasure last night... Simply amazing! Our waiter John is truly professional. The entourage waiters bringing out the 10 course meals was phenomenal! We upgraded to the white truffle and other dishes , not to mention 2 bottle of wines @$500... What a night!"
"I can't wait to be back! The Michelin restaurant of Santa Monica, we tend to celebrate all our birthdays here, and have no intention of stopping. Definitely take the wine pairing, not only is it spot on, but the waiter will kindly top you off if you were a bit too indulgent!"
My wife and I chose the 10-course tasted menu and found the food portions very tiny. I unfortunately chose the pork over the duck and found it tasteless. The wines from the wine pairing were nothing special I thought. The waiter had a friendly manner but it seemed a bit rehearsed. The dinner was supposed to be a 3-hour experience but ours lasted 3 and a half hours. By then my legs were feeling cramped and my neck stiff from the small booth. Overall it did not meet my expectations due to the tiny portions given the high price.
"I have been a Paton of M√©lisse for over 15 years. I have waited for several months and have waited eagerly to try the new and improved M√©lisse,which I did this evening. Sadly, the experience left me wanting. The food was fine but not exceptional. Given that the old Melisse Was a Michelin 2 restaurant, I expected more. The service has become sterile and impersonal, which is unlike my many prior M√©lisse experiences. For example, I requested a nightcap and was told that I would have to have the drink in Citrin, because they needed the table for the second seating. My pre dinner ticket is approximately $500.00 per person. I would expect given that price, management would have built in time for patrons to enjoy their evening. I felt rushed the entire evening. I'm disappointed :("
"I've been here a couple times now, and for some reason, I was far more impressed with their Dine LA tasting menu (pictured) than their full-blown 10-or-so course dinner. It's possible that I didn't fully enjoy my first experience here just because of how long and filling (and expensive) the meal was. But their Dine LA tasting menu gives Spago a run for its money as one of the best tasting menus deals, especially since Spago didn't participate this year. Very fairly priced for a variety of creative and satisfying plates. Both upgrades - the caviar egg and truffle risotto - are worth it. The wine pairings weren't bad, but didn't really elevate the meal for me. Their parking lot turned patio seating is actually pretty nice and wouldn't discourage me from coming back during COVID."
"The food was absolutely delicious, but the evening was ruined when I ate something I was slightly allergic to. On the one hand, our waiter was incredibly accommodating to my allergies, meticulously checking everything that was served to me and working with the chef to adjust dishes that had elements I couldn't eat. I also appreciate that the waiter took ownership of the mistake, helping me recover after I started feeling ill and comping a significant portion of the bill. On the other hand, it's disappointing that something nonetheless somehow slipped through the cracks. At the end of the night, neither we nor the waiter could figured out which dish had the guilty allergen, which is somewhat concerning from a restaurant of this caliber.

Despite all this, I'm still giving Melisse 4 stars. The allergy incident seems like a fluke, and the food I ate before I started feeling ill was exquisite. My wife had the vegetarian tasting and I had the four course tasting with the beef tartare, the salmon, the duck, and a delicious chocolate dessert that was dreamed up on the spot to accommodate my allergies. The beef tartare was divine. After my first few bites of the salmon, I was initially underwhelmed, but as I made my way farther into the dish, it all came together and was quite good. The duck was delicious too. I also sampled some of my wife's tomato soup and cheese course, which included several of the best cheeses I've ever tasted. The cheese was served with a port-like grenache that paired incredibly well with the blue cheese. Unfortunately I felt ill during most of the cheese course, so wasn't able to fully enjoy, but what I did sample was delicious.

Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone, with the caveat that they need to make some adjustments to their allergen control."
"ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS

The five course dinner and wine pairing for my birthday was absolutely fabulous.

Here are the plates: grape with goat cheese and pistachio, amuse bouche, fois gras, monkfish, duck, and cheesecake. Each dish had a different type of wine.

I was in heaven!"
"Been to this restaurant a few times. 1st time around still remains the best experience. It hasn't gotten better since. But food, pairings and service is consistently great so it still remains to be a good go-to restaurant when making reservations for friends and good company."
"Over all, the food taste is good.
But both of us get VERY SERIOUS DIARRHEA after the 7 courses We dinner. IT HAPPENS RIGHT AWAY! And our stomachs are not feeling good for more than 5 hours even after the dinner.
I believe that are something not really fresh thing in our food."
"This is a nice, pricey restaurant - good for special occasions (unless you happen to be wealthy - which I am sure a lot of the clientele are). Loved the French menu selections, which change according to the seasons. The food was delectable and the service very, very good. Whenever I'm back in Santa Monica, would love to return again. It is considered one of the top restaurants in the world - and it shows. For a really special dining experience, take your loved one there. You won't be disappointed. (No, I do not work for them)."
"Melisse was my first Michelin Star experience and I enjoyed it a lot. I came here with three other people for my birthday and everything about it was what I expected from a Michelin Star experience. We went for the full course menu and brought our own bottle of wine ($500+)The sommelier was experienced and knew what to do with the bottle we brought in, helping us decent it.

Since it's been a year, I don't remember all the details about the food but I do remember the egg caviar was amazing. I also loved the selection of bread available. Knowing me I probably ate like 6.

Service was good and attentive. At the end they gave us a tour of the Kitchen. For my birthday, they gave me a box of truffles. I would come back again. I believe the price is very fair for what you're getting."
"This restaurant is a little heavy on the seafood. So if you are not a seafood person, I wouldn't recommend it. It's a room located inside of Citrin that you can access or enter in through the street off of Wilshire.
There's about seating for 14 people and they only have 1 service a night I believe. The whole experience will take roughly 3 hours. The whole time, they are playing music and you are so close to the kitchen that you can see how your meal is prepared. Service is fantastic and they work like a well oiled machine. The food and wine is expensive and we ended up paying around $1200-$1300 with tip for the 2 of us. The food was great and I have to say that I enjoyed it much better than The French Laundry. Definitely would recommend this place if you can grab a reservation."
"With over 680 reviews, what can I tell you that might be new? Let me attempt without posting what might be the 500th picture of the same dish. Instead of raving about the caviar egg, how about I tell you about the butter or bacon bread? Yes. Got your attention; didn't I? Bacon. Bread.

**Service, tipping, and price**
Last night was well worth the steep price tag. Everything is relative, and you get what you pay for. Adage stays true. Please tip the servers generously, even though the meal is pricey. I made sure that I didn't skimp and gave at least 20%, because they did treat us very well last night. I have been to other fine dining establishments that did not offer a comparable level of service but did also come with a steep bill. It's true what the other reviews state. The ratio of servers to diners was high. When the white table cloth suffered an unsightly stain (my fork had parsley sauce on it and was placed on the table accidentally by me), they came back later and placed a white sticker on the tablecloth to cover it up. I like that. It minimized the unsightly stain without disrupting the experience.

Pleasant dining experience- isn't that how you want your fine dining experiences to be?

**A little about the food**
I had the five course tasting menu. Knowing that my meal consisted of tastes, I gladly ate both my bread rolls, thinking that I had plenty of room for all the food. At the end of the night, I was absolutely full and could have lived without eating both my basil bread roll and bacon bread slice. The green basil roll smelled divine, as I am a huge basil lover and use fresh basil in my meals often. The basil role did not taste exactly like basil, but it was interesting and shaped like a little muffin. The bacon bread was very interesting and fun to eat. You could see small bits of bacon in the bread, and you could smell bacon immediately when bringing the bread closer to your mouth. Of course, you could also taste the bacon. If you like bacon, you will love this bacon bread. One of my pet peeves at any restaurant is having heart better served with my bread. I often have to resort to warming the butter in very interesting ways. Put it under your soup. Rub it in your hands. Put it under a warm drink. Put it under your warm bread. None of these warming techniques are ideal. What was ideal was what Melisse had set on the table. Butter that was so soft, so spreadable, and perfectly salted. I didn't have to get creative with warming it up. Thank you. It's a small detail to most who may prefer to read about the truffle menu instead of the butter, but to me, these are the details that make dinner more enjoyable.

The truffle- I went for the $55 supplement corn pasta dish with the foam and freshly shaved truffles on top. Worth it. Baby, it's worth it. We all know how much truffle costs, and they give you your money's worth of truffle shavings.

It was my first time dining at Melisse, but I would definitely come here again.

Added a pic of the take home chocolate truffles, since everyone shows the pretty box but not the inside... :)"
"Went here twice. They have 3tasting menus you can choose from. 4course meal-$135, 7course-$170ish 10course-$195ish.
I love food here. Good french food. Personally i think for the price, it is really good (unlike some other restaurants)
Will be back!
And i recommend this place."
"Oh. Em. Gee.

I don't even want to tell you what we blew on dinner here. It's one of the most expensive dinners I've had outside of one at a private club a number of years ago that was around 900$. That's all I'm gonna say!

A trio of us came to celebrate my belated birthday. After some very delicious amuse-bouches which consisted of goat cheese and grapes and other delicious ingredients, we all opted for variations on the 4-course menu but added truffle risotto and a truffle egg dish. I LOVED the truffle and egg dish!!!! Runny egg and buttery bread to sop it all up with. Delish. I also opted for the dry aged steak, which was done to perfection, and the sweet pea soup was truly so good it was to die for.

At one point we all had five different wine glasses each on the table and our sommelier was hilarious and knowledgeable.

We had a great, great time, with delicious food and it was super relaxing. I didn't realize it was a menu of courses, and as I am up at the crack of dawn for yoga and workouts, I might've tried to leave work earlier to get an earlier dinner time. Needless to say, yoga did NOT happen this morning but it was all good ;)

This is a fantastic place to have a leisurely dinner, provided you're willing to drop a nice chunk of change. And it's worth it, so never fear!"
"Our party of 8 booked a birthday dinner for a friend in the group at Melisse on a weekend evening and we tried out the 10-course menu as suggested by the waitress, the only female on the restaurant's wait staff of about 30 men. Frankly, I would not eat here if I have a choice but I did not make the reservation and came along as a team player and a close friend of everyone in the group.

Let's break down our dinner at this restaurant per Pete D's four criteria, based on our group's 3-1/2 hour dining experience, wherein we occupied the center table under the chandelier in the middle of this restaurant. Contrary to Pete's perfect score for this joint, I'd give it two stars, a generous offer given the many elementary faux pas this restaurant had committed.

1) Ambiance: The restaurant is nicely decorated but stuffy, lacking the charm or essence of a true nouveau cuisine French Restaurant. Our group sat in the middle of the restaurant, given that we are the biggest group in the entire facility and, therefore, had a full view of the dining room. The tables are set cafeteria style, with booths along the elevated walls. The diners are exposed, even by sitting in the booths since the dining area is open and the walls/booths are juxtaposed with each other.

There is no noise, at any lively level ALLOWED. When the birthday ice cream with a single candle were brought out for our ""birthday boy"", we all sang Happy Birthday in a moderate voice. One of the male waiters walked quickly by our table through a scrum of other waiters serving the dessert around table and made a ""Shisssshhhh!"" sound for us to be quiet as he quickly walked away. Unbelievable sense of rudeness and unprofessionalism, despite the fact that the female waiter, who was the lead wait staff at our table, had previously told our group to be ""as lively as you want to be"". Our group was disgusted at this waiter's conduct and would put him in his place had he not inconspicuously and quickly walked away through the din of his colleagues. Our group was not even loud and even if we were by this waiter's hyper-sensitive standard, that is not how you tell your guests by ""shissshhing"" them!

A second development occurred when the women in our group took photos of this special occasion with their smart phones. The restaurant was a bit dimly lit and flashes went off from the phone. One of the bald-headed waiters in a stuffy suit came by and admonished us that we can take photos, but please do not use flashes.

Okay. I can understand that, but definitely do not appreciate the restriction, which was not told to anyone before hand or written anywhere. Strike two on this stupid and overly snobbish restaurant. We are not in a freaking church here. We are at a restaurant and we are celebrating a birthday. It is a festive dining occasion but we were mindful of other guests and their sensitivity. But again, we are not attending holy Sunday mass here.

Recommendation: If Melisse has an anti camera flash or anti-birthday song policy, or any singing for that matter, then post your policy either at the reception area, the door, or even place a nice flash card on the dining table. You can have the policy engraved on a nice and expensive card or sign, too. But please! Don't try to be overly pretentious and snobbish about these things. Can someone tell me which restaurant in Southern CA whose waiter/waitress would ""Shissshh"" the dining guests for singing happy birthday to their friends? Unbelievable! Are we to expect this kind of behavior from a 2-star Michelin restaurant?

2) Service/presentation: Other than the two incidents described above, the service by the other wait staff was fine. Still, it does not matter how good the soup maybe, if you find two ""bugs"", literally and figuratively, floating in your soup bowl, how would you feel? Indeed, the ""bugs"" ruin our dinner in an otherwise fine dining experience.

3) The food, overall, was fine, but definitely not two Michelin stars, and not at the price it is charging. Many of the entrees require different types of sauces, which is unfortunate because the sauce sometimes overshadowed and overtook the main ingredients. The squab tasted raw and chewy. The Banyuls reduction sauce did not take away the raw fleshy taste of the bird. The flat iron steak was also chewy and neutral in taste, but for the sauce au poivre. Again, a good steak does not need any sauce to cover it.

Overall, I have eaten at restaurants that are as good, or even better than Melisse, in a very nicely decorated environment, but without the need of Michelin stars and the inflated price that came with it."
"""Cuisine Fran√ßaise"" by Josiah Citrin at its best in Los Angeles. Excellent $145 tasting menu and a superb wine list, can't be much better. Came here for my birthday dinner on the invitation by my darling wife. Very professional service in a cool atmosphere. Highly recommended!"
"Nothing's changed, food's still eh, service is still awesome. I even asked to speed up the courses cuz i really don't like eating for 3-4 hrs, and of course they were more than happy oblige. Group of 5, 3 bottles of champagne, and the fixed course was about 2k with tax and tip."
"The service, food and intimate ambiance is unparalleled at any other restaurant I have been to in Los Angeles, possibly the world. I thoroughly recommend Melisse if you are looking for the best. Be sure to try the egg caviar and foie gras and get the wine paring. It's worth it."
We visited this for the first time recently and we were beyond impressed! The chef is very innovative. The food was excellent and the service was top notch! I highly recommend this place and would be great for any special occasion! Definitely try the Cheese tray for pre-desert.
"Went here last night and ordered the ten course. Decor inside was very 80s, complete with tablecloth and glass blown paperweights placed in the center of each table. The menu felt equally dated, especially the egg caviar thing. I felt like I was in a scene from American Psycho."
"First time here and I'm a fan. Thanks to Dine LA was able to try a few items dishes and loved them all. The duck was my favorite, but then, it was all good. Service was incredible as well and the setting very beautiful as they made up their parking lot into a permanent looking patio. Not at all like the ubiquitous tents you see across town. They did it up right and would love to see them keep the patio around after Covid.

Wish I could remember all of the dishes, but we enjoyed the wine pairing and cocktails a little too much :)"
"Beautiful dishes, food is tasty but not amazing! Service is amazing. The place is beautiful. Ive been there twice and I had a great time . Though, I should add that The price is wayyy too expensive for what you get to eat. But overall its a good place to experience atleast once!"
"Good service (but be careful, they will tell you that you HAVE to try this wine that goes with your dish...then charge you $20/glass for a 3 oz pour)......

the food was marginal. its tasty but the portion sizes are a joke compared to the cost.
i had in and out after.

nun said."
"If you open up the dictionary and look up the words ""perfect romantic dinner"" M√©lisse is THE definition.

Truly a beautiful experience. The staff was super attentive and informative. Every single course brought out looked like pure art. And tasted like heaven.

Need I say more?"
"Worth every penny.

Would I eat here every day/week/ even month? Probably not. But I don't think that is what this restaurant is about. It is somewhere to go once in a blue moon and get your socks knocked off by how the chef can create different flavors - both subtle and strong."
"One of the best French restaurants I've had in California!

Me and my boyfriend celebrated our three year anniversary here and it was amazing. We got to our table and received our menus from our server. He was extremely helpful and nice. We took a while choosing our set course (either 4 courses, 7 courses, or 10 courses) but ended up choosing the four because they didn't have the seared foie gras that day from the 7 courses menu. For the second course, the Chef actually gave us complimentary Foie gras paste because of the confusion (very very nice). I choose the egg caviar (MUST TRY), Lobster bolognese (Also must try), the duck (beautiful presentation), the souffle (MUST try). Overall, we received three dishes extra on top of our four courses. (:

This place is worth every penny!!"
"Seriously... I don't know how this place has any Michelin stars.

My family and I went here for my birthday but both the food and the service were underwhelming. We ordered the regular pre-fix menu and for the price you're paying, the food is really not that impressive. I am positive the ingredients are very fresh (i.e. seafood, meat, etc) but it's much prettier to look at than to eat. The selection of breads was good (try the green one!) and the cheese cart was pretty amazing, but let's be honest - it's pretty hard to screw up bread and cheese.

BUT the most annoying thing was we actually found a piece of cloth in one of our dishes and when we notified our waiter, he nonchalantly noted ""Oh, it must be a piece of cloth, should I get you another one?"".... like as if it was no big deal that there was a piece of somebody's clothing in our $50 dish. He did not even apologize on behalf of the kitchen or the restaurant... so rude!

Anyways, this is definitely a restaurant I will NOT be returning to in the future. Take your $$$ elsewhere."
"I dined at Melisse on a Saturday night in a large party of 12, and I must say it was an awesome experience. The servers were attentive, as is to be expected with a two-star Michelin rated restaurant. However, I'd say the service could have been better. A few times during dinner, I noticed crumbs on the table, which is a big no-no for a Michelin star rated restaurant. It could be that we had such a large party that it was difficult for them to be attentive, so I'm willing to give them another try with a smaller party next time. That being said, the food was pretty wonderful! We had a tasting menu prepared especially by the chef de cuisine. Here was our menu:

Amuse bouche: Japanese wild scallop with kumquat foam and caviar
First course: cream of broccoli w/ burata raviolini
Second course: lobster bolognese
Third course: prime short rib 3 ways
Dessert - chocolate cake

The scallop was delicate and delicious, however, I wasn't a fan of the kumquat foam. I actually hate kumquats since my grandma used to force me to eat them as a kid, so I'm a bit biased. The cream of brocooli was not very memorable.. probably my least favorite of the night. The lobster bolognese was my favorite! The pasta was perfectly chewy and springy, and the lobster in the bolognese sauce was so sweet! The bolognese sauce itself was bursting with flavor. I only wish that I could have switched the cream of broccoli for another forkful of the lobster pasta! The prime short rib was tender and expertly prepared, but I think it is hard to ruin prime rib. In fact, I can't even remember the 3 different preparations because they all pretty much tasted the same. The chocolate and caramel dessert was absolutely heavenly! Decadent, rich, and fantastically wondrous. I'm not a big fan of desserts usually, but this was spectacular!"
"My awesome blossom friends took me to Melisse for my birthday. What can I say... I have great friends! :)

We opted to go with the Chef's 10 course tasting menu ($150/person). Our waiter stated the tasting was around 2.5 to 3.5 hours... but it was actually closer to 4.

Before the tasting started, we got goat cheese covered grapes and grapes on a spoon that popped in your mouth (4). It was quite good. I enjoyed it. They also had quite a selection of bread but my favorites were their basil brioche and olive bread (4/5). The accompanying butter was to die for :) They also gave us this italian soda that was extremely citrusy... we all made sour faces after we drank it (4/5).

Amuse (5/5) was this oysters and avocado dish. It was quite divine and a nice start into our menu. The oysters were so good... no ocean taste at all. All of us were quite impressed.

Egg Caviar (5/5) was one of the best I've ever had and it was probably my favorite that night. LISTEN to your waiter's directions!!! Start from top and go all the way to the bottom of the egg shell to get your different layers without puncturing the egg shell! Then mix the contents and eat it! Make sure not to puncture the egg shell... one of my friends apparently did not listen to the directions and punctured the shell and made a mess at a 2 michelin start restaurant... quite embarrassing... haha

Wild Japanese Kinmedal (4.5/5) which consisted of wild radish pods, tomatoes, cilantro & apple milk was quite refreshing. It was very good.

Sweet Pea Soup (5/5) was amazing. I loved how the soup wasn't too grainy for a pea soup and I loved the small amounts of split peas you encountered throughout the dish. The accompanying whipped black truffle was quite magnificent and went well with the soup.

Poulet au Riz (4/5) which consisted of Uruguayan Rice, Chicken Oysters, Fava Beans and Mousseron Mushrooms. It was good and I loved the crispy chicken oysters. But it was alittle on the creamy side.

Santa Barbara Spot Prawn (3.5/5) was good. It was light and refreshing but I thought there wasn't anything too special about the prawn. Don't get me wrong, it was nicely prepared but it's just that it didn't wow me. My friends opted to get their White Asparagus instead of the prawn for an extra $10 (4/5). I personally like the White Asparagus with Oregon Morel Mushrooms more than the prawn. The mushrooms was so good.. rich and meaty.

**In addition to the 10 course tasting menu we added on a Lobster Bolognese (5/5) to share because it's one of my friend's favorite and it was quite delicious. I am glad we decided to get it and share it!

Halibut (4/5) with Green Asparagus, Oyster Mushrooms, and Black Sage Veloutte was awesome. I loved how meaty the fish was. It was really well prepared. Very good.

Veal (4/5) with Braised Veal Cheek, Swiss Chard, Smoked Carrot, Chanterelle Mushrooms, Lamb's Quarters. The veal was well cooked and juicy and tender. I loved the braised veal cheeks... so good. The smoked carrots and mushrooms were divine. Very good. I wasn't a fan of the swiss chard and could have done without it. My friends got their Devil's Gulch Quail instead of the veal and said it was good.

Jasper Hill Farms ""Winnimere"" (2/5) was the cheese dish. I personally thought it was bad but maybe you need an acquired taste for this dish. The smell/taste was very pungent... and I am a person that like smelly cheese but this dish was alittle too much even for myself. I had a bite and that was it.

Chocolate (4/5) which consisted of their Guanaja Chocolate, Caramel, Peanut Butter, and Coffee Ice cream. Everything was good except I would have preferred that they didn't add salt at the bottom of the coffee ice cream. It was way too much salt and way too salty. I would just enjoyed the ice cream on its own. Overall I liked this dish.

Lisa Cherimoya, Cara Cara Orange and Tapioca Pearls (4/5) was quite divine but I don't think I am a fan of cherimoya's texture. But overall a very refreshing dish and nice finish to our tasting menu.

At the end they gave us more desserts consisting of chocolate chip cookies, strawberry chocolate macarons, dulce leche, blackberries, and this jelly thing. I thought it was better than the actual chocolate dessert plate (5/5).

For drinks, I had their Cameron Coup which is their whiskey cocktail drink and it was good. I like my drinks strong and it did not disappoint. My friends also got their Les Restes and they said it was good.

Overall it was a 4 star experience for me because I think I was more impressed in the beginning of the tasting and then everything became not as impressive as we went into our main entrees. For the time and cost, I just expected more.

The service was impeccable. Everyone was awesome at Melisse. Couldn't ask for more in the service department.

PS. Loved the box of chocolate truffles they gave me for my birthday! Yay me! :)"
"Maybe I am not a ""foodie"" the food was alright, the service was outstanding as I would expect. As was the price. For me it was just not worth it, was it tasty? Yes the bite and a half size morsels are delicious. I did not calculate the dollars per bite but it is probably 5 to 10."
"My father flew in from Switzerland and chose to enjoy a dinner here. The food is beautiful, delicious and so elegant, meant to be surprised, seduced and savored. My photos wouldn't begin to do it justice but the experience was unforgettable. My ""toque"" is off to you, Chef Josiah!"
"The best takeout since lockdown started
Packaging well done with great instructions on warming such as 20 sec for a wonderful lobster bolognese and five to 7 minutes for delicious fillet

So good we takeout following week with the same tasty results spicy arrugula salad strawberries burrata cheese excellent dressing then king salmon mushroom sauce that we got spoon to finish and spiced duck sliced serve rare with those wonderful mashed potatoe just hit the spot

Easy to pickup organized correctly treat yourself it is well worth it"
"Great food. white truffle risotto, although an expensive addition to the tasting menu ($80), well worth the price. shaved truffles until the risotto was completely covered! Wait staff attentive, but not overbearing. Definitely a great place, and one of my favorites in los angeles."
"The best. Everything was top noch and definitely comparable to places like le cirque, Fleur de Lis in Vegas, maitre d in la jolla. Service was attentive but not overbearing and the sommelier was informative but in a short version way. We spent a car payment but worth every penny!!"
"Went there for a little celebration with my wife. Ambiente is ok, I would have expected a bit more for my most expensive dinner ever. Service was excellent, very attentive yet not intrusive. We didnt go with the 10 course meal, but the food was up to the standard one would expect. Much impressed by the wine list, great selection from off the beaten path wines (Austrian whites anybody). By the time we were done we were at 450$ including tip and taxes. Was it worth it? I guess every once in a while yes, although imho a bit overpriced"
"I've been meaning to try Melisse for years. I tend to push off visiting closer-to-home restaurants more often than not. We finally decided to try due to DineLA, but in the end went with one of their course menus. We did the 7-courses and added on the fromage and ""upgraded"" some other items. We also ordered a cocktail each and a bottle of wine.

I actually really loved our experience here, more so than at Providence which seems comparable. I liked the simple elegant interior that wasn't overly pretentious and instead made you feel pretty comfortable. Waitstaff was excellent. Service in general was pretty great. I enjoyed every dish that came out and was starting to feel very full towards the end. When we return, we may stick with the 4 course menu so we don't feel uncomfortably full."
"All I can say is that this place was so amazing I loved my experience here.

We had reservations and were escorted to a booth in a relatively busy night. Expect to spend like 2 hours here because they really know how to let you soak up a luxury experience!

4 course meal: it's a course meal that you get to pick bits and pieces of, basically a customized course meal. They have the option of flat or sparkling water (and the servers/bus boys never confuse it and keep your tiny little glass filled throughout the whole 2 hour duration)

As each course comes out, they explain to you in detail what each dish has and how it was made and how you could eat it, so it's like a 2 minute lecture of what's in front of you every time LOL but it's nice to know what you're consuming.

I love how professional everyone is and the ambiance. The interior is simple yet elegant. Service was of course 10 stars out of 10, you bet the food was great!

If you're thinking about coming, make sure you save it for a special occasion! Treat yourself to a great meal."
"As someone else also mentioned the atmosphere is very pretentious ..

We felt very uncomfortable .. The service was very attentive, they probably filled up our glasses three times in five minutes. We sat for a long time and no one came to get our order. Finally when we were asked for a drink we gave in our order. No one ever introduce himself/herself through out the night , nor did anyone explained any of different menu options to us.
The Chef sent out table two amuse, they were def good! interesting to say the least.. We got the ten course meal.
THE FOOD ITSELF WAS AMAZING.. the service I wasn't a big fan of.

I can't really do a comparison with Providence.. somehow I felt alot more comfortable at providence and their cheese cart was def better...
Here they treated us as second class citizens , not sure why, maybe the fact that we were two young ladies, wearing jeans

The staff was very knowledgeable to say the least which was pleasant. They did mess up in setting our plates and such few times.. which was fine.. Will I go there again? Probably not! I would go to Providence over Melisse simply because they made me feel better.. and food .. they were both very good.. just wish providence also had the caviar with egg .. OH MY .. AMAAZINNNG
I'M GIVING this a five star for the food mainly"
"A blurry whirlwind of truffles, caviar, egg yolk, creme fraiche, lobster and buttery champagne. I almost became desensitized, unable to know what ""good"" truly was anymore. You almost have to taste something bad for contrast. I woke up in the morning wondering if it was all a dream."
"One of the best restaurants I've ever experienced. The word exquisite is requisite after my lovely Valentine's Day meal. From beginning to end all of the details are carefully plotted out.

Incredibly romantic, expertly executed.

I suggest you book early for Valentine's Day dinner"
"A favorite. A weeknight and we walk in around 9 pm. About half the tables are empty and the others are filled with an interesting mix of an older crowd, and a few quiet dates. Initially not the best of impressions but that didn't last long. By the time we left, every table was taken and for good reason. The food is what truly makes this spot. From the bread - a selection with some of the best I've had - to the soups - poured tableside and well very well composed - to an absolutely unforgettable bass dish... If you can afford it, go."
"Got The ""10"", which was a 10 course tasting menu that everyone at the table had to order. It was a 3hour dinning experience that left me mostly underwhelmed. Most notably, the Coriander Crusted Aged Liberty Duck tasted like salty orange marmalade.

I'm surprised more reviews don't mention this, but Melisse had the worst restroom that I have ever seen at a ""fancy"" restaurant. Ladies room had two stalls and an tacky sink that they tacked some linen on. I have seen nicer restrooms at a chipotle.

Save your money and try something else."
"I love this place. If you want top quality definitely check out Melisse. I have been there for my birthday 3 years in a row and I think that is where I'll be spending all my birthday dinners. The food is amazing and the service is 5 stars! My profile picture is that of the banana mousse. OMG is that to die for. Everything I have had there is fabulous. Definitely try the truffle egg. Yes it might cost a little more than your typically dinner but if you want to impress your date or if it's a special occassion, this is the place to go."
"We had dinner for two here last night. We had the $135 set course. Food was amazing the chef is very creative and flavors blended well. The only complaint I would have was that it was way overpriced we ended up paying $740 for dinner ! $740 without any drinks or specialties. The set menu has a set price of $135, however they charge extra for ""supplements"" which they recommend and make it seem that you can replace at the same price but that is not the case. Every supplemented dish ranged from $10-$130 hence the hefty bill. Overall it was a great ONCE in a lifetime experience but will not be returning it is overpriced and not worth the amount we paid. Service was great and feel I was persuaded to choose ""supplement items"" without knowing I was going to end up with this ridiculous bill."
"Had dinner reservations at 6:30pm this last week with guests from out of town. On arrival we were informed that SCE had turned off power for routine maintenance. This was initially scheduled for 9am but just happened at 5:45pm and they expect power to come on by 6:30pm. What was odd for a 2 Michelin star place was to not call the guests ahead of time and give us options. We were dressed up and waiting on the sidewalk with valet folks not even taking our cars and told us to park on the street with metered parking. I finally asked to speak to the manager and said, why don't you give us an update and provide us with an alternative place. It's virtually impossible to get reservations at a fine dining place on a Sat night at the last minute. The restaurant never opened, as power would be out till 10:30pm. The manager provided another recommendation but the place was not a fine dining option.

Incredibly poor hospitality for an establishment at this level. I bet you, they would have taken my money if I didn't show up for their pre-fix menu."
"This review is for the Melisse 14-seat experience, re-opened under Chef De Cuisine Ian Scaramuzza in 2021

Restaurateur Citrin is a creator, he and his team are among the best of LA to inspire the future LA food industry.

I owned Chef Citrin's two books, Charcoal and Pursuit of Excellence. I read and learned so much about Chef Citrin through his books, just wish I get a fraction of what he does from the books.

Apprenticeship is a rare form of learning. Nowadays people learn from video and/or subscribe classes over internet, and unsubscribe if it's not a good fit. The training and intensity won't be the same as apprenticeship would be told what do as instructed until mastery of one basic technique, such as pealing tomato skins for months.

During pre-Covid pandemic, Melisse was under construction to split into Melisse x Citrin, where Citrin is designed to be an A La Carte restaurant showcase some signature dishes.

Please view my photos for the food portion of the review. Everything was excellent!!! But I would like to offer one caveat that I felt short throughout the night was thinly sliced Hokkaido scallops. These are dry and did not carry sweetness of seafood flavor. In my opinion, I want my scallop either raw, cooked to perfection (lightly seared) or smoked (this would be dry). Since there's no smoke process for dryness then perhaps I am not a fan for particular preparation. Everything else were presented immensely over the top! We had nothing but the best ingredients for the entire meal, the dinner was one surprise after another, from beginning to the end, thanks to Chef Scaramuzza and the team.

Lastly, thank you, Sommelier Matthew for the wonderful hospitality experience!

Matthew was definitely that very key element to an enjoyable dinner at Melisse.

I'd like to bring up one notable incidence. This night we had the most privilege with Chef Citrin greeting each table and allow us to take photo with him. When it's our neighboring table's turn taking photo with Chef Citrin, I step aside so they can have a full frame of the artwork behind. As I return to my seat, I accidentally drop my fork onto the floor. Chef Citrin was a least 15 steps away by that time, within 5 seconds, his dolphin ears heard the silverware dropped onto the floor. I gestured that it is ok, but Chef Citrin came back and picked up the forked himself with Sommelier Matthew replaced the fork as the next move. I genuinely appreciate the attentiveness of every personnel really taking ownership as if it's their business. I was definitely baffled to get such a treatment."
"Good, but not exceptional. There's not a particular dish that stood out to me, but overall, I enjoyed my meal. The presentation and service was great. I love how they brought a little stool for my purse to sit on. I'm not in a rush to come back here, but wouldn't hesitate to return."
"Thanks DineLA that's how I heard about this classy upscale restaurant. I ordered quail, oyster beef rib and it all tasted so very delicious. The server was great he gave me a quick brief description of each plate and how it was prepared. I went during the week and it was full house."
"I feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to visit here on a couple of occasions.

The first time was on a whim, years ago (2007), prior to them being awarded a Michelin star.

We ended up ordering the Sample of 10 with wine pairings and what an incredible culinary experience. We were so excited to to try the next dish and wine. By the end, when the elaborate cheese cart was brought by, I felt like crying that I couldn't eat more. As an added bonus, the chef/owner, Josiah Citrin, sat at our table, chit chatting and thanking us. No, THANK YOU.

Last year, I had the opportunity to attend a Private Dining Event in the Olivia Room. Everything was exactly as I remembered: warm, intimate and romantic. Plus, incredible service, food & wine.

My personal favorite restaurant in Los Angeles."
"Oh how I wish I had a ton of money so I could eat here every week. My husband and I have always wanted to try this place since seeing the critics review in a local LA magazine. Recently he took me here for my birthday and we were beyond pleased with every single thing we ordered.

The white asparagus with morel mushrooms were divine, the soups and bread choices were divine, the little samplings they give you to taste were divine, and everything else was divine! We were not disappointed.

Yes the portions are a little small since they are big on flavor, but both my husband and I left way more full than we do with most of the restaurants we frequent! I also have to mention the service. Everyone was wonderful with not one trace of snobbery. We enjoyed every minute and will be back again."
"Dined as a group of 5 on a Saturday night, brought 2 bottles of wine and bought 2 bottles. Selected the 10th Anniversary tasting menu.

Food - This is really why you go, the food was fabulous, plated beautifully, hot, fresh, delicious. Some fun combinations of things...everyone loved the fois gras. Loved the amuse bouche and the rolls too.

Wine - We bought two whites, I had brought two reds, the sommelier was great, he was friendly, approachable and unpretentious. I had a old bottle of 1966 Lynch-Bages and he talked to be about decanting and whether I should do this....he made it easy and didn't make me feel inferior! 5-stars!

Service - service was 5 stars also, we did have to ask for more butter twice but other than that it was pretty flawless. I thought maybe a little too long between courses...but it gave our group time to talk, needless to say we were there from 6:30-10pm.

Overall 5 stars. I've been to Providence and Sona....I'd have to say Sona is probably my favorite of the three, but I'd go to any of them again.

bon appetit!"
"Amazing service and cuisine! Loved our dining experience at Melisse and felt totally comfortable with their outdoor setup. Glad I finally got to visit and will be back again soon! Highlights were the lobster bolognese, hamachi, sirloin, and duck. Everything was incredible. Thank you!"
"Never fails to amaze!!!
Chef Citfin and and chef Scaramuzza delivered once again an outstanding progression/ tasting menu that was simply delicious. Matthew was professional and knowledgeable as always selecting outstanding wines throughout the dinner and Fernando is simply the best."
"This is BY FAR the best restaurant on the westside. Brian, the Somm- fabulous. Best in town. And what is this crazy rumor we hear about the bar going away?? One can never go wrong at Melisse. But, one can get seriously fat by eating those whipped butters. Oops. I mean potatoes. What is it 60/40 butter/potato? Seriously! Do the tasting whenever you can and always include wine. Brian is a master at wine pairing. This is my favorite place in town, along with Providence and Locanda V- for a great meal. Oh, and a burger at Father's Office."
"Surprise! Your dinner tonight will be at the fabulous Melisse in Santa Monica. At least, that is how the text message went from the fianc√©. Best dinner I have ever had in a restaurant. Impeccable service and food. I was amazed that they iron out the table cloths in between guests. We were going to have the tasting menu, but decided against it. Our courses were as follows...
*Grape thing (can't remember the name) that explodes in your mouth, literally.
*Parfait with different kinds of foam, asparagus and cashew.
*Fish thing, ya I can't remember that either.

Again, this was an amazing dinner, thank you Kenny (head chef). Everyone was so nice and welcoming. The wine was amazing too, thanks to the wine guy. Everything was just great and amazing, I can't wait to go back. I finally found a place where I can celebrate my anniversaries and birth dates, providing I can afford it =)."
"if a meal costs $$$$ and you are voted 5 stars from Forbes, um, yeah, i am going to expect a LOT from you.

the best way to describe my experience at melisse is It was just so Lovely. i know my experience was exponentially better due to our waitstaff, danica--she was lovely, experienced, and savvy.

i tried 10 course tasting menu which is only $25 more than 4 course, my favorites were the lamb entree and truffle risotto which came with an extra $75 charge. (but i have to say, they did shave off a plate full of truffles)

the desserts were incredible! i really liked the final course--how i'd like to describe as delicious jelly rancher in the most luxurious way. then danica sent over ""crackle jack"" --delicious & sexy crackle jack i've ever had--on the house because she insisted i should try it. woowhoo! (she also made sure the beef was cooked to my friend's liking, putting the customer's request first rather than how chef dictates)

no doubt melisse is one of the most expensive restaurants. however, if you have a special occasion to celebrate, this is The Perfect Place. the service was formal & a little french--everyone was polite and attentive.

p.s. there's a sign when you walk in, ""no phones and flash cameras."" yay! no annoying flashes blinding you while enjoying your 3 1/2 hour dinner."
"Not sure if my review belongs on Citrin or Melisse's yelp page. Sadly my birthday fell in December during a complete ban on dining so we decided to get the nicest possible takeout we could find. We went with the 5 course takeaway and added the caviar egg (because obviously). For 2 people I received 2 HUGE bags of food with multiple containers and reheat instructions. What I didn't think through, is what a pain it is to eat three bites of food and then return to the kitchen to cook the next course (the other option being cook it all ahead of time and eat most of the food cold). I spent most of my time in the kitchen cooking it rather than eating it. However I like to cook, so TBH, being able to cook a Michelin meal that was essentially already mise en place for me was actually kind of fun, especially at a time where I have nothing better to do. I also question if the tip etiquette changes for such an expensive restaurant. For instance in the restaurant, the waiter/ess would have to my table multiple times throughout the evening and basically working for one or two tables over the course of 3 hours, and for this, $100+ of tip seems warranted. But to simply place a bag in my trunk, it doesn't seem like $100 worth of effort. That being said, I know the restaurant industry is hurting right now, so I'm torn. The dishes came out very tasty, but please read on...

They sent a very long list of very detailed instructions with lots of containers which were clearly labeled, enabling us to figure out which sauce went with which dish (although this part took a lot of time too). One instruction said to microwave a container that didn't appear microwaveable, but I trusted it anyway (I should have trusted my instincts--the container melted in the microwave). But the worst part was probably when my husband ended up with intense food poisoning a couple hours after dinner. In fairness, food poisoning can kick in up to 48 hours after eating, so perhaps this was unfortunate timing (also in fairness, I didn't experience any food poisoning and we ate the same meal--maybe he just had a bad scallop? or maybe he's allergic to melted plastic?). So I can't really blame the restaurant for this, but I have to say it was somewhat of a drag, and for that I had to decrement a couple stars as the timing is rather suspicious."
"I have been here before around 5/6 years ago, before this place was remodeled, and when I came back, I was surprised. The decor had definitely become more open and lit up (still dark lighting though) and it had a more spacious feel. I like the new look.

Anyways, the three of us decided on the 10 course meal for $150 (only 30-50$ more than the 6 course meal i think) and got Chef Citrin's cookbook for an additional 35$. The server said it would be around a 3 hour dining experience, we got out around 11 (dinner reservation at 8).

Bread- so many options! I really liked it.. I wish it wasnt cold though.

Amuse Bouche- green grape covered goat cheese and a purple grape jelly. I do not like goat cheese, but I enjoyed this one.

Afterwards, another amuse bouche of boysenfruit (I think) smoothie which was sour and tangy. Very refreshing.

And then.. another amusce bouche with oyster and apple cider gastranomy. It was very interesting. Okay finally.. the first course.

First Course- egg caviar w soft poached egg, lemon creme fraiche, and american domestic caviar. The dish was yummy, probably the favorite of the night. The puff pastry complemented the dish perfectly. 5/5

Second course- Wild New Zealand Tai Snapper with radish pods, tomatoes, cilantro, and apple millk. I really like the infusion of the fruits and vegetables with the snapper. it was light, tangy, and flavorful. One thing I noticed was that the flower tasted delicious with the dish. lol 5/5

Things started going downhill (kind of) from here...

Third course- onion and parmesan veloute with peeky toe crab cakes. It was okay.. nothing special. 3/5

Fourth Course- Poulet au Riz w Uruguayan Rice, green asparagus, black trumpet mushrooms, and jus de Roti. The chicken was good, everything went well together. I enjoyed this one. 4/5

Fifth course- seared diver scallop with violet artichoke, blood orange, and macademia. It was solid, but at this point, I would expect more from a two michelin star. 3/5

Sixth course- black bass w braised scales and braised fennel, white mushrooms in a black mussel broth. The fish was yummy, and the broth and mushrooms went well with it. Yum. 4/5

Seventh course- We got the $25 supplement of Satsuma wagyu beef strip loin w smoked and glazed potato, black kale, oyster mushrooms, sansho pepper jus. This was amazing. so delicious. The beef melted in my tongue. 5/5 On the other hand, the aged california squab with roasted sunchoke, black berries and black elderberry reduction was okay.. it wasn't that good. 3/5 Good thing I got the supplement.

Eighth course- Tartiflette with reblochon, smoked bacon, mead reduction. Basically a cheese tart. I was excited for it as it melted when i broke open the pastry, but was not happy. I tasted the rind of the brie cheese (I hate the rind its bitter) and it did not go well together. At all. We didnt even bother to finish this dish. 2/5

Ninth Course- Chocolate dessert with guanaja chocolate, caramel, peanut butter, and coffee. It was like chocolate jello and random stuff added on. I was forced to finish the others' plates because they did not like it... 3/5

Tenth Course- Apple, green tea, and ginger beer. I guess this is a redemption from the previous dessert, it was very light and refreshing. I dont like ginger, but I enjoyed how it complemented well together. Love green tea. 5/5

Mignardses for the table- strawberry macarons, jellys, chocolates, cookies, etc. typical stuff.

Service was very attentive and was there when we needed them. They knew their dishes and when we asked specific questions they were able to answer. Also decanted our wine that we brought because it was older which was very nice. Plates came together, and was served together.

Overall, Melisse definitely had its ups and downs. The food was solid and decent, but I definitely expected more from a 2 Michelin star restaurant. Service at least was amazing and on point for a 2 Michelin. Our bill for three total came out to be $615 without tip, and I don't think it was worth it for what they gave us. In my opinion, Providence was better. At least I had a good experience!"
"Our party of four ordered the 10-course chef's menu. Simply put, spectacular in every way. Our evening was more than a great dining experience; it was an EVENT, a showplace, an evening of wonderment and choreographed so perfectly. Get this...I made a few colorful spills on the white tablecloth that made me cringe. Our server had white ""stickers"" she casually plopped on my spills to camouflage my messiness. Never experienced that awareness of ensuring the diner feels at ease. Sidenote: four years ago I hosted my mother's 80th b-day at Melisse (it's her favorite restaurant). We had a private area set up for our celebration and as far as ""special events"" planning goes, the experience was first-rate in every way. She (and all our guests) to this day still talk about that incredible evening!"
"What is dinner like at one of the few restaurants in L.A to earn two Michelin stars? Service is impeccable, wine list outstanding, food is extraordinary and in my view the best food one can find in LA for this price range. Bring your checkbook.....but enjoy. The service is simply perfect, the food is thoughtful, fresh, and original, and the dining room is reminisent of France. You can order a la carte or a prix fix menu. We had the chefs tasting menu and it was amazing! We had high expectations and they were met and exceeded. What a spectacular experience from beginning to end. The service was among the best we have ever experienced. Can't recommend it highly enough. They surprise you with their combinations and elaboration, maintaining the original flavor while creating new sensations."
"This is my favorite fine dining restaurant I've been to in the LA area. I recommend Melisse ahead of Providence (both 2 star michelin).

Where do I begin? The service is INCREDIBLE. Always. I've been several times, and I always feel very special, whether I come alone or with friends. I've had the 4 course meal, and I've also done the 10 course tasting menu. Both are fun, but I recommend the tasting menu. Slightly smaller portions, but a very fun way to try many of their specialties. Make sure you ask for the cheese cart during the meal, as there are incredible choices! The tasting menu even comes with 2 desserts. It's hard to pick highlights, but I would way that the caviar egg, the foie gras, and the John Dory fish were wonderful. And the cheese cart (hint: ask for the triple creme cheese).

The owner has come out and greeted the guests at their tables on two out of the 3 times I've been here. He is so friendly and unpretentious. I seriously love this place.

On a special occasion, please try this restaurant. You won't be disappointed!!"
"I'll just steal my girl's write up from facebook (with some edits)...she said it best


Originally set out to try the dineLA 5 course menu but decided on the fabulous 10 course dinner instead, at M√©lisse from 2-star Michelin Chef Josiah Citrin. The food, plus wine pairing and fantastic service, hand-crafted bowls, lighting, table set up.. EVERYTHING was impeccable. We both left full, satisfied and blown away.

First of two Amuse Bouches, 2 preparations of grape
oysters with pomegranate, cocoa nibs (and other ingredients I don't remember)

First course - Egg Caviar - soft poached egg, lemon cr√®me fra√Æche, oster American caviar, paired with a 2007 Vouvray, Petillant, Huet, Loire

This dish was so fresh! Second course - Poisson Cru - baby turnips, black mustard, yuzu paired with a 2011 Sancerre, F. Crochet, Loire

Third course - Potato Leek Soup - smoked haddock mousse paired with a 2011 Gruner Veltliner, 'Thal', Heidler, Austria

Fourth course - Poulet au Riz (chicken with rice) - Uruguayan rice, English peas, yellow foot mushrooms, jus de roti paired with a 2010 Bandol Blanc, Domaine La Bastide Blanche, Provence

Perfectly cooked, sweet scallop. Fifth course - Hokkaido Scallop - salsify, whipped truffle, parsley nage paired with a 2010 Vouvray-Sec, Domaine Clos Naudin, Loire

Talk about decadence! #trufflesdeservetheirownhashtags Fifth course - Five Cheese Agnolotti - shaved black truffles paired with 2010 St. Joseph Blanc, J.L. Chave, Rhone

I've always loved Monkfish, especially Ankimo, but the texture of this reminded me of scallops and it was amazing. Kinda bummed they didn't include a spoon with this dish because that sauce is amazing! Sixth course - Monkfish Cheek - braised cardoons, bacalao, black trumpet mushrooms, sweet garlic emulsion paired with a 2011 Chateauneuf-du-Pape Blanc, Domaine de la Solitude, Rhone

Two words: SO GOOD Seventh course - Sonoma Lamb Loin - Swiss chard, Nantes carrots, puffed quinoa paired with a red wine (didn't get the name)

Did someone say duck confit and crispy skin? Seventh course - Aged Liberty Duck - parsnip, pear, forbidden rice, acorn crumbs paired with a red wine (didn't get the name)

I don't know how I would've stomached the cheese cart, this was still a generous amount of cheese (#lactoseintolerant) but I have to say, she had me at bacon mousse! Eighth course - Tomme Rabelais Rodolphe le Meunier - smoked bacon, medjool date, peppered honey paired with a 2008 Quarts de Chaume, Ch√¢teau l'Enchardi√®re, Loire

All I can say is I ate it all. And the mint was a nice touch! Ninth course - Chocolate - guanaja chocolate, caramel, peanut butter and coffee paired with an MV Madeira, New York Malmsey

Lastly, a great palate cleanser. I love this dessert! Tenth course - Lisa Cherimoya - tapioca pearls and cara cara orange

Thank you for an amazing dinner!!!"
"A place that has earned its reputation based on great food and service.

Great wines. Awesome meals, and their risotto is amazing!! Their truffle is from
Another world and their bread is a piece of
Art.

Pricey, yes, absolutely. But go there knowing your palate will have foodgasms !!!!"
"One of the best dining experience. From the service to the food, everything was impeccable. An ideal place to bring your significant other.

My bf took me here on a random night and our bellies were both pleased. Food was creative and delectable. WIne list was extensive and impressive."
"I've been lucky enough to go to Melisse for a meeting, which means I wasn't paying. Even better, my host is French and way into food and wine. So this all adds up to a wonderful experience.

The wine selection is terrific, and there are actually many many bottles that are reasonable but sought after and superb. Everyone at our table had the tasting menu, and everyone had the lobster bolognese to start except for one that had the soup. Superb starter, this dish was extremely light and tender and the earthiness of the truffles were perfect with the sweet lobster meat. Just delicious. Second course for me was the salmon, which was not quite equal but still very tasty. Of the two, I could see the salmon as an entree that would make a wonderful meal. After two seafood courses I decided to go with the duck, which is not something I order a lot but I figured it was probably terrific here. Sure enough, another great dish. The duck was mild, but the cherries and beets were a perfect combination, with lots of flavor when everything comes together.

We also went through about 15 cheeses, all of them either good or great. A very expensive night with a few bottles of wine, so I highly recommend going there when someone else takes the check! I will be taking the wife there for the anniversary menu soon."
"My friends and I went there three years ago to celebrate one's birthday, and that was a meaningful experience. Professional service and elegant decoration. Everything was near perfect, but I just cannot give the deliciousness of the food 5/5. Maybe I'm just not that into French cuisine."
"One of the best meals of my life. The food is fresh, seasonal and the flavors are amazing. Try the tasting menu with the wine pairing and you will find flavor combinations that you didn't even think were possible. I think my favorite dish would have to be my wife's fois grois with the riesling pairing, to die for. Everything is good but let the chef work his magic. Don't go if you are a picky eater or the type of person who wants to substitute ingredients and thinks they know best. Humble yourself, there is a reason you are not the chef."
"Thank you for making my birthday such a wonderful evening!! Love coming here for celebratory and ""just because"" dinners!!

Also, we always forget , but it's important to note that their champagne is $40 a glass (or at least the Rose that they always offer to me when we go! Hahahahaha!!)

I know some people don't enjoy tasting menus, however if you are the adventurous type and don't have too many food allergies and restrictions- I highly recommend coming by Melisse (just tell them ahead of time what your preferences and restrictions are)."
"My husband and I have really enjoyed our dining experiences here (we've gone a couple times for our anniversary). We most recently tried their ""10"" menu and it was a rather delightful meal. From the amuse bouche up through dessert, the dishes were beautifully prepared and most delectable. Highlights were the caviar/egg concoction, Reed avocado, yellowtail, and most notably the black truffle risotto. I didn't find the cochon to have much flavor, not sure why that was. I enjoyed my cucumbery gin cocktail (the Dauphine, I believe) and my husband was a fan of the drinks he ordered (one was a mint Julep). The wait staff was knowledgable and very friendly and I love the predominant purple decor. Their dishes are lovely as well. Come here for a special occasion, or if you want to treat yourself!"
"I need to research again on what gives a restaurant a Michelin star but Melisse is not deserving if it's an all around competition. Yes, 5 stars for the food but they lacked in service and execution. We dined at Melisse tonight for our 1-year wedding anniversary. The tasting menu - my husband had the seasonal tomato menu and I the traditional - was excellent. We both had the wine pairing. The sommelier was classic LA - rude and arrogant. Yes, I will be that candid because I would hate for someone else to read the other reviews and I think this place is deserving of their Michelin rating. If you can get over the loud atmosphere, the pretentious waiter and sommelier, then this is a great place. I can't believe people will compare this to French Laundry - not even close!! Read up on Thomas Keller, it's about the details from back of the house to the front. I don't want to hear the staff talking about the next seating nor do I want to experience the sommelier telling me he doesn't have time to write down the wines I just experienced because he's too busy. Folks, when I am dropping $475 for two for dinner I expect service - take notes from places like French Laundry (Napa), Le Mer (Honolulu), Testsuya (Sydney) and Sona (LA). Don't get me wrong - food excellent but it gets muddled by the details."
"**Review for Valentine's Day Special **
The boyfriend wanted to try this place out to cross off another Michelin Start restaurant off our list. We got a reservation for Valentines Day and the experience was all worth it.

I personally love the attention to customer service and how each specific person played a roll to our dining experience. If you are paying top dollar for this it needs to include a memorable experience down to the toilet paper they use! I was very satisfied with the service which made the night more fun!

We did a wine pairing for all the dishes that night and my favorite was their choice of champagne we had. Yes I forgot to take a picture of the brand so I can remind myself! I wish all champagne tasted like that!

My favorite dishes of the night:
- Scallop with this foamy froth - light and rich at the same time. The tenderness off the scallop made me wanting more!
- Foie Gras - Butter in my mouth!
- Tartare - perfectly dressed
- Beef - Super tender and fatty

I'm glad I was able to enjoy great food with a great companion!"
"I don't understand all the great reviews of this place. Went here with work, so all expenses paid, we got the tasting menu, and added the truffle egg to it. Everything was just ok. This goes back to what I said in one of my other reviews questioning all the people in LA's taste buds. Is it that you're convinced it's amazing because everyone else says it is and because it's so ridiculously expensive that you almost have to like it otherwise you'd feel guilty wasting the money?

I know I'm not the only person that feels this way about this place. Three other people I've spoken to after the fact have expressed similar opinions after having gone there.

There was one wine that was out of this world - a rare pinot noir that was earthy and delicious (and pinot noirs are not normally earthy). But having to spend $195 on a bottle of wine doesn't help the cause. 90% of the dishes fell short and I wasn't impressed. Not only that, but the atmosphere is so stuffy and quiet, it's hard to feel comfortable there.

Do yourself a favor, and save your money!"
"Went here on my birthday in February and it was pure heaven. As much as I am for animal rights, I'm really sad that foie gras will be taken off dining menus this July. Sooo... I went ahead and ordered the 10 course foie for all tasting menu!

-Foie Gras Cromesquis
-Foie Gras Flan, Blood Orange Gel√©e, Toasted Hazelnut Foam
-Torchon and Crisp Foie Gras
Red Beets, Endive, Celery, Aged Balsamic
-Truffled Foie Gras Agnolotti
-Chicken Oysters and its Consomme
-True Day Boat Scallop ""Rossini""
-Roulade of Foie Gras and Eel, Rice Paper, Cauliflower Couscous, Smoked Cabbage Emulsion
-Prime Beef Rib Eye & Braised Beef Cheek, Cured Foie Gras, Leeks, White Mushrooms, Foie Gras Parfait
-Foie ice cream

I missing something in there but that is the jist. It was all amazing but the beef cheek & rib eye w the foie gras was my favorite. I'm still not sure how I feel about foie ice cream though. It was good but I could have gone w a foie-less desert. I thought I would be foie'd out by the end of that meal but I wasn't at all! I felt like I was on iron chef battle foie grasEvery dish had a unique preparation with various textures and different flavors that I didn't get sick of it at all (is that even possible?). Everything was just melt in your mouth awesome. I wanted to jump on my chair and shout, ""Bring on the foie!"" But its much too nice of an establishment to do something like that.. there is even a sign that says you cant take pictures inside (but dont worry I snuck some in and will post them for all to see). . Catch this menu before foie is banned in July!"
"Melisse is one of my favorite restaurants on the west coast hands down. The staff is very knowledgeable with both the food and wines. I loved the everything from the first course to the last. I go as often as possible, considering it's not your typical Tuesday night dining out experience."
"Absolutely one of my favorite restaurants if I want to go high end. The food is what gets its first Michelin star, but the service is what pushes it into two star territory, and Melisse definitely deserves its two Michelin stars. The menu is a bit confusing, with a large variety of options and courses, but the wait staff is hands down fantastic, and are so eager and enthusiastic to share their opinions and expertise with you. If you are worried about snotty service at high end restaurants, please try Melisse and have those fears dismissed."
M√©lisse has proved why it is the ONLY 2-star Michelin star restaurant in the Los Angeles area. The service is among the best and attentive I have ever seen in a reataurant. The wine menu is reminiscent of an encyclopedia. So many choices to choose from that you'll lose your mind. The dark fancy atmosphere sets the tone for intimacy in such an inviting environment. The waiters did an excellent job explaining all the items offered in detail. The water refills were nonstop. The food was very unique and made to perfection. Prepare to come ready to drop some coin as well as a lot of decision making because the menu has too many items to memorize and the price you pay for the food here is all about the ambiance and the experience that very few restaurants can afford to offer. M√©lisse has 2 Michelin stars for a reason and is among the finest restaurants in Southern California as well as the United States. Such a wonderful place to celebrate a milestone moment in your life as well as taking that special someone on a breathtaking dining experience.
"Last night of the M√©lisse run.. Ok, the service was top notch, the sommelier was happy and helpful, the food was at times great but mostly kinda not deserving the Michelin stars nor the price point. We had Ros√© champagne, Chardonnay and a bold, bad Zinfandel that made up for it however.."
"Wow - what an amazing establishment! I actually ate here with my boyfriend and his family for a special occasion six months ago. I unfortunately don't remember exactly what I ordered, but the experience was almost kinda magical!

Service was truly top notch from start to finish at Melisse."
"I took my wife for a special holiday dinner right before Christmas and once again Melisse did not disappoint. From the first glass of champagne, through the most amazing cheese board I've ever seen, this reminded me that for my money Melisse is the best fine dining experience in the city. My personal favorite was the egg caviar. Totally devine. Our waiter Douglas was awesome. Knowledgeable and every move executed with flair. Even Chef hung out for a while and made us feel like regulars. Now if only I could afford to eat there every week...."
"Melisse is my absolute favorite place to dine! I just returned from a fabulous extended trip in France yet my culinary desire remains Melisse. The atmosphere, gastronomic creations and personal attention, especially from Doug Delancey are unequivocal. Doug expertly finesses my dining experience by anticipating my every want and need with perfect poise and unobtrusive perfection. I wish my creative writing skills were as amazing as my experiences at Melisse so I could provide the restaurant and especially Doug the raving review they deserve."
"Having been to some of the best restaurants from LA to NYC to Paris to Moscow, I was underwhelmed by M√®lisse. We spent about 2.5 hours there for dinner, however the dishes are so small leaving a lot of time for dinner talk. The Dine LA menu has a surcharge of $50 to add truffle risotto, the portion could fit in my palm, as pictured. Dinner started with an oyster, just one, not a fan, nothing special for the price. The rest was so underwhelming that I don't even care to sound so bitter with a bad review. My review wouldn't be so bad if the price matched the quality of the food. There was probably 1-2 ounces of edible lamb as the main, taste was great but so small. We ended spending well over $500 for dinner for two, there are other fine dining restaurants I'd rather spend that much money at."
"Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think a chocolate planet would blast my taste buds out of this universe! The soup, the service, the smiles! This restaurant makes magic come to life at your table and Doug made our night with his never ending smorgasbord of graciousness, humor and zest!"
"Couple days ago we went to have a dinner at M√©lisse. We selected the 7 course meal. We got very small samples of strange tasting things in big plates. Most of us didn't touch it because of its fishy odor. To reduce the risk we got two different main dishes. The steak was dry and the fish was raw and fishy. We couldn't eat it. When we went home we had stomach ache. Add to that is the huge bill, we paid $1,400.00 for the five of us. To be fair I have to say that you get strange looking dishes and Three to serve you.
It is an expensive lesson."
"Inexplicably delicious...any occasion is a special occasion at Melisse. This restaurant is for connoisseurs of fine cuisine that have a sophisticated palette to appreciate the nuances of every savory bite.
I have come here for birthdays, New Year's, and celebrations of all types and have never once been disappointed. The cuisine is a beautifully presented melody of flavors and textures that titillates my taste buds every time. I adore the Chefs Tasting Menu with the wine pairings. The sommelier is so knowledgeable about the dishes it is like they were truly made for each other. Not for penny pinchers it is very very pricey, but an absolutely exquisite treat. One of my top french restaurants in LA if not #1. There are plenty of nice restaurants out there, in my opinion this one is exceptional."
"I will add my voice to the chorus and say this place is incredible.

We were seated at a big, beautiful, comfy booth that overlooked the whole restaurant and proceeded to spend 5 hours eating 14 delectable creations each (28 plates between the two of us).

The poached egg was fantastic-- full of creme fraiche and caviar-- and the risotto was the best truffle dish I 've ever had, complete with fresh, table-side truffle shavings from a large, beautiful black truffle. But the highlight for me was the Cochon de Lait... it was pretty much perfect in every way from the egg on top to the barley underneath.

We had 8 servings of cheese.

By the time the chocolate cake came, our heads were spinning. And it was the 2nd of 3 desserts!

Wine list was excellent..... and they were giving generous pours of the house bottle. Our server was awesome in general. And Josiah Citrin was on a surfing trip but he still tweeted me some well wishes and gratitude for dining at his establishment, which is always nice!

If I win the Lottery, this will be my local hangout!"
"This used to be my very favorite restaurant in Los Angeles for the past 7 years. I never missed a winter truffle season! I for some reason was a bit disappointed the last two times I went here so Im saddened but no raving review for them at this point.

Accessibility: 5/5 restaurant is very easy to find. Valet parking available. Don't park in the residential area because you will get a ticket!

Ambiance: 5/5 elegant, impeccable, minimalist, quiet, excellent for romantic dates and special occasions. I love that they bring you a little stool for your purse!

Food: 4/5 I usually do the ten course tasting menu with wine pairing. If truffles are in season, you better believe I will order as many truffle dishes as humanly possible. Presentation of course is excellent, food is also excellent but I feel like you don't really get a decent size of anything. This is the only place I can eat all 10 courses, 4-5 pieces of their awesome bread rolls and I don't have to unbutton my pants!

Service: 4/5 I believe service is not the same as it used to be. Still good, but not exceptional. I used to never have to call anyone to refill my water or get me more wine or bread. I found myself trying to get the waiter's attention a few times and this, for a restaurant of this caliber is not acceptable.

Bang for your buck: 4/5 I really don't mind paying $ for an outstanding meal. In this case though I feel that Melisse is falling short. I no longer feel the meal was worth every penny. I feel like their food is overpriced compared to other restaurants of the same caliber."
"After reading so many great reviews about this place, I finally got to try here on my birthday thanks to my BF. Inside the restaurant was nice and the ambiance was super high end. I see a lot of people here looking like they are coming from rich Beverly Hills area lol As soon as we reached the table, I saw a nice note saying happy birthday to me and a nice box of chocolate. Since there were a lot of waiter, I was expecting service should be efficient but we waited for about 10-15 minute to get our order which I felt it quite disappointing.

We chose the 10 course menu. Since it's a lot of food to memorize, I would not go over one by one, instead, I will highlight my favorite items.

Amuse: This was panna cotta with fresh salmon roe and oysters. Since its my first dish, it was quite refreshing. Creamy panna cotta and fresh salmon row actually made a great combination. It was also super colorful, orange, green, purple and gray which definitely increase my appetite.

Egg Caviar: It was caviar in the soft scramble egg. I had to dig into the egg cause you can't take the whole thing out and eat it otherwise the egg yolk would leak from the bottom. The flavor was nicely balanced.

Artichoke Soup: This soup was AMAZING! It was creamy and flavorful. They put a little parmesan cheese cracker in the middle of the soup. The cracker melt inside my mouth with the sip of soup. Literally drooling thinking about this... The presentation was also amazing.

Stonington Maine Diver Scallop: I am always a huge fan of scallop, as long as you do not overcook the scallop, I would enjoy it. They did a amazing job in cooking the scallop, it was crispy on the skin and center was tender and juicy. The veggies on the side though, was a little bitter.

Caramelized Chatham Bay Cod: I love this dish. The cod was sitting on pureed cauliflower dressing. I love how the cod was glazed or cooked to dark orange color and created this bitter sweetness. Dipping with the broth definitely made me want to take bite after bite. I really enjoy this one.

Prime Beef Rib Eye Cap: This was the main dish but one of my least favorite one ( others are some dishes I did not list out here like Foie Gras Torchon or Romanesco Cauliflower) The steak was okay. It does not have that melting in my mouth effect. Nothing to rave about. I would say maybe it was because I was amazed by those appetizers?

Chocolate Nutella Crunch: My favorite dessert time! I really like this dessert. I love dessert but not a chocolate lover, however this chocolate nutella crunch definitely made me fall in love with chocolate for one moment. It was not overly sweet and it has crunchy, creamy and smooth texture. Definitely a light chocolate dessert!

Cherimoya: Chef ending our tasting with this super refreshing fruity dessert. They also gave us complimentary tea to pair with dessert which I appreciated.

Overall I had a great dining experience here even though this is not somewhere I would come often. Some of the dishes definitely impress with their flavor and plate presentation. Valet parking is $8.5 with the restaurant parking lot."
I guess after eating at Joel Robuchon nothing will compare when it comes to French cuisine. Melisse is good but not extraordinary or memorable. We tried the four course menu and my favorite was the foie gras. The halibut was also perfectly cooked. The lamp was ok and the pineapple souffl√© tasted similar to a rice pudding with fresh pineapple on top. I'm sorry but the price and the quality of food doesn't match up! We will not be going back; I may have to wait for my next Napa or Las Vegas trip for a taste of French cuisine in the west coast.
"Opulent contemporary French food with personable and inviting service. The wine pairings were perfect (even better than Providence). The foie gras, caviar egg, and ""Camembert"" Meunier were the highlights. The duck and rib eye entrees were ok, somewhat of a let down. The only restaurant I could compare this to would be Providence and Maison Akira. It's biggest competitor, Providence, is slightly more to my liking; more creative recipes and visual presentations, nicer environment, feels more refined in general. They both are exceptional though."
"I'm pretty late in writing this review, so I'll make this fairly short. I love this restaurant, and all the other reviews probably cover anything I could possibly say. Don't be fooled by the exterior, because once you step inside, it's a whole different world. The staff was amazing, and the courses were even more so. However, I felt like there was just ""too"" much time between courses compared to similar restaurants that serve multi-course meals, such as Providence. The meal took so long that we decided to forgo the dessert courses and leave. I don't get the ""3% health"" charge added to the bills here, and I think the restrooms should be a little ""nicer"" at a restaurant of this caliber. All in all, the pros outweighed the cons, and this is somewhere I would frequent if I didn't live so far away."
"Michelin French Cuisine Los Angeles MelisseÔºÅ

This is Michelin's innovative French restaurant
Because my friend told me that this place is really good. It was closed for a while for other reasons.
First of all, this place is very easy to book. I ordered the special for two with wine and some truffles, 2700$ including tip
This time I went with the general feeling that the menu also includes Japanese miso soup and chicken wing rice hahaha I really think it's amazing
Every dish is delicious and the service is also very good, especially the background music is very good
The entrance to the restaurant is very hidden. I searched for it for 20 minutes.
Upon entering, it was a very small room with good privacy and only six tables.
fully open kitchen

"Valentine's Day Weekend Dinner - 4.5 stars

Our first introduction to Josiah Citrin's culinary delights were a couple years ago when he was a guest chef at Meadowood in Napa Valley. The problem was, my wife is a vegetarian and the vegetarian menu seemed like more of an afterthought. When I suggested Melisse for Valentine's Day weekend dinner since we moved down here, she was hesitant, but agreed to give it a try. She was extremely satisfied with her meal and mine was fantastic as well. We've been craving our favorite red, Altamura's Sangiovese, and sure enough Melisse had a bottle. More impressively, they didn't overcharge us for it like most restaurants would. It went perfectly with our dinner and we'd love to dine here again but will have to wait and save up in order to do another $600 meal."
"Visually pleasant is what comes to mind when I think of the food here. I'm actually leaning more towards giving the food a 2.5 star rating since the dishes just reminded me of Chinese inspired cooking. Many of the dishes used ingredients and flavors you normally find sitting in a family style Chinese restaurant.

The service helped bump up the star rating since I really liked the attentive staff that tried to describe the food with lots of whimsical merriment. Moreover, if something was not to our liking they were able to take the critique and try to accommodate.

I think the only memorable dishes to me were the beef check and one of the herbaceous breads (there was about 6 kinds). I can't say I would return again unless the chefs create food that really stand out and entice more than my eyes."
I always eat and spend too much here.
"This restaurant was exactly as I expected superb. The food was incredible. The dinner started with a scallop tartare and gazpacho from the chef, then I had the fois gras on top of cherries followed by the lobster bolognese and then veal and a souffl√© for dessert. Highly recommend this place."
"Had a disappointing meal in NY the day before a trip to LA, so I thought I'd try an upscale restaurant in SoCal. Made a reservation on opentable from the plane before taking off.

The restaurant did not disappoint. The food was creative, the service good. The sommelier recommended a great wine. There was a little too much food so they packed one course to go for us.

If I had to nitpick, the restaurant was a bit noisier than I would have liked, tables a little too close together. Romantic restaurants should keep couples away from large groups."
"I had the most amazing 16 course food and wine pairing the other night at #melisserestaurant. Was so sad when chef @josiahcitrin shut down for almost a year to reinvent the concept, decor and food. My first time back since he reopened a couple months ago and it was worth the wait. Thanks team for an amazing experience. Not only watching you all work and experience the food but to share the dining room with another living legend Chef Mori @morihiroonodera and overhearing he and Chef Josiah discuss what went into the dishes we were being served."
My husband and I go here for our wedding anniversary every year for the past three years. It's hard for me to want to go somewhere else for such a special night because they take such good care of us. From the congratulatory note and truffles waiting for us when we sit down to the special dessert at the end everything is so beautiful and special. The tasting menu is really fun and beautifully presented. It's hard to pick what my favorite course is but I love the surprises they add in. The service is phenomenal but not stuffy at all and you can tell everyone who works here takes pride in their job. The breads they have are really good and it was so hard not to fill up on the green basil brioche bread. You have to get the caviar in the egg course. It is a very cool contraption and tastes so good.
"Melisse is a great restaurant - but a bit over priced for the food quality.

We dined there yesterday and did the 10 course meal with wine pairing and the truffle risotto.

The wine pairings elevated the experience to probably 4 stars but we weren't there for just a wine pairing, we were the for dinner.

Highlights:
- The staff (especially the somaliers) are amazing. The place works like a finely tuned orchestra.

- The wine pairings were truly out of this world. Every wine chosen was flawless and that for us was the true exploration and star of the night.

- Great ambience.

Not so good:
- A LOT of the food fell flat for me. Boring, bland, or bitter flavors. Nothing that really made me want to live in that food. It looks stunning, but the flavor combinations often felt at odds with one another or pretty unremarkable. Some exceptions: The foigras toast and the blood orange vanilla pannacotta. The rest were just ok or passable.

- If you order the risotto with truffles (my only choice since I am allergic to shell fish) it's an extra hidden cost of like $75 per. And it's just ""ok"" taste wise. I wouldn't order it again. I understand the rarity and quantity of truffles they use is special however the dish overall just felt boring and uninspired.

- 10 courses with wine pairing will run two people roughly $1200 (with tip) for the night which is more expensive than Alinea and on par with French Laundry in price but nowhere near the food quality.

Due to the exorbitant price and the lackluster performance of the food, we probably won't return to Melisse."
"Enjoy your dinner! Because here you will!

Really tasty and delicious. I should say separatly about desserts, because this is OMG!

You really should find a time and come try!

Best serving and wonderful design.

If you will invite your girlfriend for a date here, believe me, she will love it!"
"It's the best French restaurant in Santa Monica! There were suitable wine list with the orders, and it's classy atmosphere. Some employees qualified as a sommelier so that feel comfortable if you love wine. The meals were also perfectly well-done! I would go have dinner here forever for sure:)"
"My dinner here felt like a trip to the museum... I was inspired and hungry upon leaving.

The menu is seasonal so this review may vary- as my struggle with my experience was the taste and quantity of the food


The bread was amazing- a wide variety of tasty breads. I asked for more

The service is impeccable. I feel like the waitress had only our table to attend. She took her time to explain each dish.

The atmosphere wan innovative but classy. Purple is a difficult color to execute. Melissa did it well.

We got pesto baby tomatoes for our second dish- one with pesto outside of tomato, one with it inside. The texture difference should be noted as the second ""pops""

The meal was followed by a series of experimental smaller plates. They were surprising- like the decor, but not impeccable in taste. The portions are small and my boyfriend asked to stop at Jack in the Box on the way home. I whipped up some pasta one we got back as well. We were both still hungry.

My dinner here felt like a trip to the museum... I was inspired and hungry upon leaving."
"Melisse.. I have been here before around 5/6 years ago, before this place was remodeled, and when I came back, I was surprised. The decor had definitely become more open and lit up (still dark lighting though) and it had a more spacious feel. I like the new look.

Anyways, the three of us decided on the 10 course meal for $150 (only 30-50$ more than the 6 course meal i think) and got Chef Citrin's cookbook for an additional 35$. The server said it would be around a 3 hour dining experience, we got out around 11 (dinner reservation at 8).

Bread- so many options! I really liked it.. I wish it wasnt cold though.

Amuse Bouche- green grape covered goat cheese and a purple grape jelly. I do not like goat cheese, but I enjoyed this one.

Afterwards, another amuse bouche of boysenfruit (I think) smoothie which was sour and tangy. Very refreshing.

And then.. another amusce bouche with oyster and apple cider gastranomy. It was very interesting. Okay finally.. the first course.

First Course- egg caviar w soft poached egg, lemon creme fraiche, and american domestic caviar. The dish was yummy, probably the favorite of the night. The puff pastry complemented the dish perfectly. 5/5

Second course- Wild New Zealand Tai Snapper with radish pods, tomatoes, cilantro, and apple millk. I really like the infusion of the fruits and vegetables with the snapper. it was light, tangy, and flavorful. One thing I noticed was that the flower tasted delicious with the dish. lol 5/5

Things started going downhill (kind of) from here...

Third course- onion and parmesan veloute with peeky toe crab cakes. It was okay.. nothing special. 3/5

Fourth Course- Poulet au Riz w Uruguayan Rice, green asparagus, black trumpet mushrooms, and jus de Roti. The chicken was good, everything went well together. I enjoyed this one. 4/5

Fifth course- seared diver scallop with violet artichoke, blood orange, and macademia. It was solid, but at this point, I would expect more from a two michelin star. 3/5

Sixth course- black bass w braised scales and braised fennel, white mushrooms in a black mussel broth. The fish was yummy, and the broth and mushrooms went well with it. Yum. 4/5

Seventh course- We got the $25 supplement of Satsuma wagyu beef strip loin w smoked and glazed potato, black kale, oyster mushrooms, sansho pepper jus. This was amazing. so delicious. The beef melted in my tongue. 5/5 On the other hand, the aged california squab with roasted sunchoke, black berries and black elderberry reduction was okay.. it wasn't that good. 3/5 Good thing I got the supplement.

Eighth course- Tartiflette with reblochon, smoked bacon, mead reduction. Basically a cheese tart. I was excited for it as it melted when i broke open the pastry, but was not happy. I tasted the rind of the brie cheese (I hate the rind its bitter) and it did not go well together. At all. We didnt even bother to finish this dish. 2/5

Ninth Course- Chocolate dessert with guanaja chocolate, caramel, peanut butter, and coffee. It was like chocolate jello and random stuff added on. I was forced to finish the others' plates because they did not like it... 3/5

Tenth Course- Apple, green tea, and ginger beer. I guess this is a redemption from the previous dessert, it was very light and refreshing. I dont like ginger, but I enjoyed how it complemented well together. Love green tea. 5/5

Mignardses for the table- strawberry macarons, jellys, chocolates, cookies, etc. typical stuff.

Service was very attentive and was there when we needed them. They knew their dishes and when we asked specific questions they were able to answer. Also decanted our wine that we brought because it was older which was very nice. Plates came together, and was served together.

Overall, Melisse definitely had its ups and downs. The food was solid and decent, but I definitely expected more from a 2 Michelin star restaurant. Service at least was amazing and on point for a 2 Michelin. Our bill for three total came out to be $615 without tip, and I don't think it was worth it for what they gave us. In my opinion, Providence was better. At least I had a good experience!"
Best fine dining french in Los Angeles.
"Absolutely an experience to have!

We got the 10 Year Anniversary Menu for April along with the Wine Pairing! Caviar to hamachi tuna to lobster bolognese to purple asparagus to a whole slew of food...

Wine pairing is intense...but worth it for an exquisite experience...

You must abolutely go!"
"Had the 5 courses menu.
Best 5 courses menu, since they let you pick and choose the 5 courses from the list of daily selection. This way you can order different items from your dining companion.
Perfect, can't find any fault at all.
Servers, Service, and food are all well beyond my expectation."
"For the hopeless romantic, you can not get a more brilliant experience then at Melisse. The service, the art, the music, the mood, the food and the setting is all intentionally and strategically done to perfection.
Unfortunately, I was in a business dinner and although I enjoyed the experience it did seem a bit uncomfortable to not be there with a romantic partner.
If the price does not dictate quality then I suggest you make your reservation for the table smack in the middle of the restaurant for Valentines Day (if you can get a table.)
Cheers!"
"We decided to go California-French for Thanksgiving and couldn't be happier. M√©lisse is as good as ever. Started out with a Dutraive 2015 Fleurie Vieilles Vignes Clos de la Grand Cour - yum - followed by scallop and foie gras appetizer, lobster ravioli, and then the turkey with three choices of trimmings. Wifey claims it's the best turkey she's ever had - she went into the kitchen and told Josiah and he revealed the secret - it was brined for days. Dessert was classic pumpkin pie, with sublime vanilla ice cream. We need to come here more often!"
"Melisse is without a doubt my favorite restaurant of all time. If there were such a thing as ""perfect food,"" Melisse would come pretty darn close. I would strongly recommend ordering one of their tasting menus, which cost around $125-$200, depending on your choice. I have always wanted to try their truffle tasting menu but haven't had the pleasure yet. This is one of the few restaurants where it's actually worth it to drop $200+ on a dinner.

In addition to their subtle, well-balanced dishes, Melisse has some of the best service I have ever experienced. Guests are treated like royalty here, and dining is an extravagant, three-hour long affair. The dishes are served simultaneously most of the time (if you have four guests, then four servers put the plates down and unveil the dishes in unison), which is a pure delight. The first time we came here, we arrived five minutes early, and they had us wait two minutes while they set the table. For making us wait (even though we were early), the maitre d' gave us complimentary wine.

I can't wait to go back."
"Awww.... it's time this place gets a review from me. I made a special request for my fiance to take me here for my bday this year. And of course, Melisse performed and gave us an amazing dining experience from the beginning to the end.

It's not cheap... but I must say, it was well worth it. = )"
"Came here last night and food and service was amazing.

We had two belated bday celebrations. That being said we had the special 15 course meal. Like the 10 course but with a few more. :-)

I would recommend to save up money if you are an average joe don't do dinela at a restaurant like Melisse."
"Am 0 for 4 at this place.

Still can't figure out how this place gets good reviews!!!

While service is good the food isn't.
The wine is outrageously priced!!!

Portions are small for what you get.
It's all about the name and going to the most expensive restaurant in la.

Go to bouchon or bazaar."
"Just went for my birthday to Me'lisse's and the cuisine was super refined and oh so good. Service was impeccable and Captain Doug never missed a beat. Super professional, knowledgeable, and oh so well dressed. Kudos M√©lisse as this was a perfect evening. Thank you for such impeccable service ..."
"I held off on writing this review hoping that our state would come their senses and over turn the Foie Gras ban. Sadly they have not, but I'm glad my last taste of Foie in California was at Melisse, as we enjoyed their Foie for All menu.

Unfortunately there isn't much of a need to elaborate on the amazing course after course of Foie Gras dishes. Instead I will give them top ratings for their service and great quality of their ingredients. From their responsive wait staff, to the awesome Sommelier Brian, we had an amazing night. I can't wait to go back and have one of their other tasting menu options, or maybe a return visit for Foie once the ban is over turned. In the mean time, off to Vegas to get my Foie fix.

A couple tips...
If you arrive early there isn't a true bar area so you may want to arrive closer to your reservation time.
Request a booth as you will get a better view of the entire room.
Ask the Sommelier for help! That is what they are there for! Brian was spot on with his recommendations and didn't try to push me out of my price range."
"The exterior is, as others probably note, uninspiring. The inside is nice and sophisticated except for the art, which we are told has recently been redone in respect of the owner's affinity for skateboarding. At such a restaurant, this seems like a curious choice.

The introductions and welcomes were nice but a touch casual. I guess that's California for you. This persisted throughout the meal. Feels like a 1-star Mich and no more from that perspective. I appreciated the chef visits to explain the dishes.

The first five or six courses were unbelievably tasty. Some of the best individual small meals I've ever had (I'm including the first two amuse buches). Incredibly flavors. This alone is worth the visit. The entrees were excellent but not quite up to the same snuff, and I felt like the dessert dropped a notch.

The wine we happened to order was one of the few sub $200 bottles and we were thrilled. Look carefully and some nice options can be found. But the prices on the wine are not reasonable in my view and the $50 corkage fee is prohibitory.

It was our anniversary and they had a nice card to welcome us for it and candles on our desserts but no other recognition.

Overall I give this five stars because it is extremely hard to find anything this delicious outside of Michelin restaurants in France and Japan; and there were no glaring problems. But it's very borderline. It could be 4 stars if the first few dishes were not quite so amazing, because it's very, very expensive, the service was a touch casual for me, and the exterior is really uninspiring."
"Came here on a Saturday with reservations. Was seated immediately. Wait staff were all very cordial. Decor is modern but inviting with plush booths mixed with various sized tables. Wife & I had the ""10 "" prix fixe dinner ($150pp). Our favorites were:

Caviar poached egg: creamy and smooth, perfectly seasoned by the salty caviar

Seared foie gras: melts in your mouth and well balanced with persimmon & cranberry reduction so the richness is not overpowering

Maryland dayboat scallop: very fresh and seared to perfection

Atlantic black bass en ecaille: skillful crusting of the bass skin to a ""chip like"" texture without overcooking the fish.

Some suggestions if Melisse staff is reading:

There was a loud and somewhat boisterous large group of people which detracted from the otherwise romantic and elegant atmosphere of the restaurant; perhaps groups can be seated in the smaller sectioned off area to minimize the noise.

The sunchoke veloute was great except for the etrog lemon. I don't mind its use to flavor the soup, but would personally take it out prior serving. I enjoyed the soup until I bit into the etrog lemon at the end which gave a sudden burst of bitterness and somewhat left an aftertaste.

Overall, I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a modern, yet elegant ambiance paired with fresh ingredients prepared in a combination of traditional and nouveau French style.

Note to the gentlemen: Should probably come with a button down shirt and jacket at the very least; casual suit is probably most appropriate. This is an upscale, 2 Michelin starred restaurant after all.

Note to Chef Citron: James was extremely knowledgeable about every dish, especially the cheeses. He was attentive and made my wife and I feel very welcome. He was also the only one among the waitstaff to always have a smile on."
"I don't tend to pay attention to what other Yelpers say about restaurants. I like to go in with a clean slate. Melisse, however, I completely agree with other people's sentiments. I had the tasting menu, and boy, was it phenomenal. From the first dish to the last, it was flavor flavor flavor. Everything was creative. I usually don't picture myself eating flowers for dinner, but that was probably one of the best salads I've had in my life. If you're really into food, there are very few restaurants I say you have to try in LA. Melisse is one of them."
"Michelin's innovative French restaurant is very easy to book. I booked the special option for two people with wine and some truffles. The tip is included for 2700$. This time I went. Overall, I felt that the menu also included Japanese miso soup and chicken wings with rice. Hahaha. It really feels amazing. Every dish is delicious. The service is also very good, especially the background music is very tasteful. The entrance of the restaurant is very hidden. I searched for 20 minutes and entered. After entering, it was a small room with good privacy."
"definitely a great restaurant to go to in santa monica.

we went for the all out-give me all ya got menu here...and man! was i stuffed. it was around 19 course or somehting like that...but it felt like 99 courses....it was a lot! with 1 course having 4 kinds of dishes in the plate. it was awesome!!! probably one of the best meals i've had... maybe worthy of a last meal before i die kinda thing....if it doesnt kill me first. :)
it was a lot of food...but be prepared to take a home equity loan for this one....but man, you wont forget it.

good stuff."
"Melisse manages to provide an absolutely stellar fine-dining experience while still retaining a sense of humor. It would be easy for such a fancy and elegant restaurant to feel a bit sterile, but the staff in both the dining room and kitchen imbue their restaurant with a personality to which diners can really connect. Little bits of unguarded human irreverence and playfulness peek through menus and the multi-hour presentations of haute cuisine.

Be warned: this is not a place for a quick bite or a casual encounter with the chef's abilities. Melisse has moved to a model of only offering fixed price tasting menus (with some flexibility and ability to add and customize a little)--declaring that they're not just selling food, but rather, integrated culinary experiences. After having their famous ""10"" menu, I can't imagine why anyone would want anything less.

The courses were beautiful and delicious. I wanted more of everything placed in front of me, but minutes later I was always glad they forced me to save some room for the next offering. Individually, the plates were good. Together, I felt like I was being taken on a tour of a country that didn't exist--part France, part California, part imagination.

Since the menu changes so frequently, it's hard to justify describing specific dishes, but I will say that the scallop dish I had was by far the best scallop dish I've ever tasted. And the kitchen worked wonders with lobster, mushrooms and chocolate as well.

Not meant for those faint of heart, faint of hunger, or in a hurry, Melisse is certainly deserving of its many accolades (2 Michelin Stars, spot on the Gayot.com Top 40 in the US list, etc.).

PS - Don't pass on the bread. Sure, some of it might be ""just bread,"" but the basil brioche and bacon focaccia might as well be tourist attractions of their own."
"In the restaurant's defense, Josiah Citrin was not working the kitchen the night we went. Overall, I think Melisse has lost a step since I went a few years back. The place is really for old people and just a bit boring for LA. I would only recommend it for a romantic evening. The service was poor for a restaurant with its reputation and the menu was difficult to navigate. We did 5 tasting menus ($95) and adjusted the menu as we pleased. The 8 adjustments cost $85. They brought around a champagne bar like drug pushers and the service dropped when we ordered tap water for the table.

Dishes rated (1 - 10), 10 being amazing. The prices indicated are al a carte:

(7) Amuse Bouche - Goat Cheese Covered Tomatoes, Pistachio $0
For an amuse bouche, I really liked this one. Simple, cool presentation, and the flavors went well together.

(6) Bread Selection $0
The brioche was great with its high butter content. Seemed only fitting to slab some more butter on it.

(9) Kumquat Mojito $12
Big fan of creative cocktails and this one hit the spot. The whole kumquats are marinated in simple syrup for two weeks, pureed and then mixed with rum and mint. I didn't taste much rum, though.

(2) Amuse Bouche - Cucumber, Tomato Gazpacho, Tomato Gelee, Halibut Ceviche $0
The cup tasted of three flavors of nothing. The halibut was ok.

(7) Sweet White Corn Ravioli, Summer Truffles, Brown Butter Truffle Froth $21
The ravioli was creamy and sweet. There was jus on the plate, I think cream or butter would have been better.

(5) Maine Lobster Salad, Tomatoes, Artichoke, Lobster Vinaigrette $29
Nothing special to me.

(1) Heirloom Tomato Salad, Buratta Cheese, Harivot Verts, Creamy Red Onion Vinaigrette $21
What did you think about this one Blane.....Hated it! Individually and collectively all conponents did not work.

(9) Seared Foie Gras, Lavender Honey Glazed Peaches, Pain D'Epice, Huckleberry Sorbet $29
Foie gras, fruit, and done well....enough said.

(6) Maine Lobster ""Thermidor,"" Cooked In Court Bouillon, Glazed In Lobster-Mustard Sabayon $27
Good, but nothing special. Bonus point for the presentation. I wish it was creamier and cheesier.

(6) Almond Crusted Imported Dover Sole, Chanterelle Mushroom, Scallions, White Corn Brown Butter Jus $53
The almond crust added a good texture and flavor, good dish.

(8) Ris De Veau, Potato Gnocchi. Lima Beans, Parsley, Jus De Roti $27
Too much French wording in the menu overall. Ris De Veau = Sweetbreads. If you have never had them, try them. Sweet, with a crisp outer texture. Kind of creamy on the inside. An underappreciated ingredient.

(1) Eastern Halibut, Cherry Tomatoes, Cippolini Onions, Green Zebra Tomato Coulis $42
Very bad, poor use of the tomato in the tomato menu. The halibut was bad, maybe they were trying to display an impressive microwave technique. Why does poaching equal no flavor.

(8) Trio Of Prime Beef, Potato Galette, Swiss-Chard-Fourme D'Ambert Gratin, Sauce Choron $43
Tough dish, I really liked this one, but everybody else didn't. I love that you get 6 different conponents and most were very good. The braised beef could have been more tender. and I could have done without the tomatoes on the side. They described the choron sauce on the back beef as a tomato bernaise, maybe they were trying to dumb things down for us. It was good, though. One person mentioned the left side was better than the right side (refer to pic).

(8) Lamb Chop, Loin And Shoulder, Ratatouille, Basil Mousseline, Thyme Infused Lamb Jus $44
How can you go wrong with lamb, tender and well flavored. A winner. I didn't think I would like ratatouille and I didn't, tasted like something old folks would like.

(7) Fresh Tagliatelle, Grated Summer Truffles, Parmesan, Brown Butter Truffle Froth $55
What do I remember about the dish? The tenderness of the pasta and the price. I hate grated/shaved truffles on a dish, present them cooked in a dish. Let the flavor come out through heat, not much flavor on the grated truffles.

(6) Liberty Duck Breast ""Poche-Roti,"" Poached Figs, Turnips, Faro, Banyuls Sauce
Not as good as Cut, but a lot of good conponents to the dish. $41

(6) Cheese Course $17
I loved the pears and kumquats. The cheeses were good, but I would prefer to just go to a cheese store. Poor service on the cheese course, couldn't explain everything. She even forgot the name of one cheese. Cheeses are sexy, make them sound that way.

(8) Chocolate, Chocolate, Chocolate $14
I liked the variety and they pump a syringe full on chocolate in the souffle. Cool dish.

(2) Cherry-Peach Clafoutis Tart, Basil Infused Cherries, Peach Sorbet $14
Maybe it melted when it got to me, but this was just flat out boring.

(4) Sticky Toffee Pudding, Mocha Malt Ice Cream, Coffee ""Tia Maria""-Orange Consomme $14
Again, nothing special. She recommended this one, not sure why.

(5) Petit Fours $0
Different flavored cookies. They were decent."
Felt frustrated and disappointed in our experience after all the great things we heard. Food service was extremely slow and delayed. A couple requests we made to auxiliary staff were complete forgot. One staff member was condescending to my wife when she asked for bread. Was expecting so much more.
I ordered tasting menu and it made me more than full. Every plate was done very precisely like an art and they all tasted great. This place would still be highly rated even if it was in Paris or Tokyo. This place has michelin stars. Not every day food but great for special occasion. Romantic place.
"Probably the best restaurant in LA.

This is proper French cuisine. Unabashed. The full tasting menu is a trip filled with caviar, truffle and foie gras. Lots of foie gras. So much that I caution getting the tasting menu if you don't want to eat every known form of it.

Cheese selection is amazing."
"I really enjoyed the dinner here, we had 7 course menu and everything tasted great. There are two desert courses which is exhausting actually and I recommend getting their herbal teas - you get a giant silver teapot of most wonderful tasting tea. We had white rose and chamomile.

I thought our table was very dark which was annoying because I asked in my reservation notes for a well lit table, I felt like I didn't enjoy the food as much because it was so dark everything just looked grey on my plate.

The service was great and their wines were divine."
"4.5 Stars

My wife and I dined here on 5/31. We decided to go all out and order the Carte Blanche 15 course chef's tasting menu with the fresh Australian black truffle option paired with wines per each course. Yeah it's a lot a money but if you want to have an Anthony Bourdain experience, there's no other substitution.

I will not go into detail about each course because I would be writing the longest Yelp review on record and I would rather peak your curiosity and recommend you experience this for yourself. Please allow for 3.5 - 4 hours of dining time if you choose the 15 course option.

The execution of ingredients for each course and wine pairing by the Sommelier was probably the best I've experienced since our dining experience with Joel Robachon. The choreography of service was on point which is important when your doing multi courses. The only blemish was when we had to wait almost 45 minutes for our 14th course to arrive, hence the 1/2 star deduction.

This is the top restaurant in the L.A. area and we will be back for sure, sooner than later."
"My visit was rather disappointing. Maybe I just had high expectations.

Came here to celebrate Mama S's birthday month which coincided perfectly with restaurant week. First, we couldn't get reservations due to the popularity of this place, so we put ourselves on the waiting list and 2 days prior got a call and got a reservation.

We each got a different 5 course dinner. The food was excellent: beautiful plating, very delicious, and definitely made to impress. The black truffle risotto was very tasty. However, I didn't like the fact that the bread was cold. My major compliant with our dinner was our waiter. He did not take the time to explain the menu, and was rushing us to order. I overheard the other servers at the other tables taking time to explain the specials and made recommendations. He was extremely impatient with me, which is not at all what I expect from a fine dining establishment. Throughout the meal, he only came to bring some of the food, the others were brought by other servers, and rarely came to check on us. Perhaps it is a busy week, but that should be no excuse to rush and ignore your customers.

I forked out over $400 for dinner for 3, and did not get the dinner experience that I had expected. Compared to the other fine dining establishments in LA and OC, this was very disappointing."
"As part of a foie consumption program designed to result in myocardial infarction on or before the start of the ban, we managed to obtain reservations at 9pm on a Saturday on this Father's Day/Graduation weekend.

Street parking readily available, we arrived just a few minutes early and spent the next fifteen or so sitting in the hall that leads to the restrooms, studying the wine menu and extensive cocktail list. Two very full pages of cocktails made for some interesting, though slow, reading - I opted for a play on the French 75, which they insist is the original version made with cognac and a French sparkling wine.

After seeing various other couples arriving after us be seated, we were finally led to a nicely quiet booth in the back corner of the restaurant. Which was probably a good thing, as I have rarely been to a high-end restaurant that was so loud ... at least when completely full.

They offer several menus: a ten course tasting and a ""carte-blanche"" that could be almost anything are offered for the full table only. There is then a somewhat flexible 4-5 course menu and currently an opulent Foie Gras tasting menu. My companion chose the Foie menu with included wine pairing, and I selected some matching courses, supplementing the 5 course with additional appetizer dishes.

Pacing, though slow, was very even. Service was generally good, though again the intricacy and friendliness of descriptions seemed to depend on the server. Once course was placed incorrectly ( they switched our dishes ) and not noted by the servers. They have a very clear policy against cell phone use and flash photography, though they do allow photo without flash. One assumes that this reminder is through necessity - a group at the next table over held a rather rousing recital of the birthday song, something I've not heard in a restaurant of this caliber in quite some time.

The restaurant itself is decorated in a modern/east coast sensibility. I found the combination of a rather warm dining room and vinyl upholstery on the bench seating to be a somewhat unfortunately sticky experience.

Bread was offered - a very good assortment of miniature rolls. The wine pairing was generous and reasonably creative. Food was competent and perhaps overly intricate, each dish having many distinct tastes, mostly matching. Flavors were a well thought out mix of French with just a little Asian and some molecular techniques. The signature egg/caviar was an excellent flavor combination and presentation. Hot and Cold Foie was very good, containing a repeat from the foie menu of an excellent and creative mousse terrine. Aori Ika - a squid preparation - was recommended by the server and had a very nice char, but a texture that might not agree with everyone. Spot Prawn was perhaps heavily salted, but a very enjoyable preparation of a quality ingredient. The Lamb went very will with the eggplant ( a charred slice, as well as an extremely strongly charred mousse quenelle ). The Foie menu was a good assortment of techniques - creative and everything we could have expected, if neither the most opulent nor the most strongly flavored we've had in these waning days of availability.

Overall, and despite somewhat distant and careless service, this has to be one of the best, if not the best, French-oriented fine dining experiences we've had in the Los Angeles area."
This was an amazing experience and one of the best dinners I had in LA. Probably best for a special occasion or a smaller party (2-4). One of the things I appreciated the most is how each chef cooking the dish comes out to present. You will love the food here if you're open minded to exotic flavors.
"Where do I start? Hmmm I can't believe this is a 2 michelin star restaurant. Americanized french food for sure. Things start off good, then one after another dish, the taste has gone downhill...... Premium price paid for mediocre french food. Sigh, typical californian restaurant. We've been to france, spain, Italy, etc. Those european countries have wayyyyy better food and their prices were fairly reasonable for the quality for food they provided. From the taste of food to Melisse's service, 2 star yelp review is fair enough. Sorry, will not be back."
"I finally made my trip to Melisse to treat my family to a special thank you dinner. Got there 30 mins early expecting worse traffic. Hostess was very smoochie-rear-endie, said she would have our table in 5mins. We were there early enough to hear the staff give the ""woop"" yell at the end of their pep meeting. My aunt asked if we were getting a booth, hostess said no, then said she would quickly set up a booth for us.

1st dish was not on menu. Some sort of warm cream of fennel soup served in a shot glass. Multi-layered green/white with a cake like bottom. We were all amazed by it.

Requested Sommelier: Guy comes over in suit and opens wine the 41 page list. He is serious and slightly intimidating. I ask him his name and he becomes my best bud, telling us he hates most of the other guests at the restaurant (jokingly of course). I give him a price point and he leaves to study his selection based on our wine preferences. He returns with 3 bottles ranging from mild to super-earthy, all French, one he forgot he had and was quite special in his opinion. I took it. VERY acidic with a fantastic bouquet and dry finish.

1st Course: Not being brave enough to try the sweet breads (bovine limbic gland), I order the Black Truffle Lobster Bolognese. The rest of the table orders the scallops - we should have ordered more variety but oh well. The Bolognese is a staple at Melisse for good reason, I love it. The scallops are perfectly seared with very Mayer lemon sauce and celery root/tops.

2nd Course: I go for the black bass over the Maine lobster. Good decision since the lobster plate is small and mild (but good). The bass has two mini black-seared artichoke hearts with balsamic-y flavor. The skin of this fish is an example of crispiness unseen before, a perfect counter to the soft white meat.

Entr√©e: 3 of us, again, all go for the same dish: 35 day aged rib eye. The beef cheek agnolotti is just like the oxtail dumpling I've had at Tar & Roses but not quite as sweet (T&R better). The rib eye is nice, but Mastros etc. provide a better steak experience. My cousin orders tableside truffle crusted Dover Sole that is intricately de-boned in front of us. It was truffle-mild and nice.

Dessert: Sticky Toffee Pudding was sweet and had a caramel/chocolate cake on the bottom with Hibiscus yogurt on top which I LOVE. My cousin's son and I go for the coconut meringue with sage beer. He didn't enjoy, it was unusual, but I liked the contrast between the bitter beer foam and sweet nitrogen chilled coconut ice cream. My cousin goes for the triple chocolate with pudding, souffl√©, and some other choco heaven I can't explain.

We thought we were done and they brought out fresh berries with cr√®me fresh, raspberry macaroons, and tiny chocolate chip cookies. The tableside chef says ""after this we offer a nap and story time"".

Love this place!"
"While most of the food was great-- I probably won't go back. We good the prix fixed menu and I ordered steak--my father had a beautiful piece of meat, but I couldn't cut through mine. They would not get me another piece of meat--were perturbed and and sliced in the back... Not for that kind of money!"
"Two Michelin Star rated
Contemporary French

The menu set up and deliciousness of the food here reminds me of Alex at The Wynn (Las Vegas). Theres a choice between the regular menu ($105 four courses, multiple choice style, can also upgrade to better dishes for more $$$), Vegetarian tasting menu ($95, all surprise), Carte Blanche (not really sure, nor is price listed) or you can go for gold and take down the Ten menu ($150 ten courses, all surprise). I of course chose the Ten menu and paid an extra $65 for the white truffle risotto. Here is what I had:


Amuse - Wild Japanese Mackerel
Egg Caviar - there was a poached egg on the bottom. This dish was really unique. I'm a salt kind of person so I love caviar.
Wild Japanese Kanpachi - really good, the sesame glazed things were delicious
Dandelion Veloute - I got excited when the description said that there was going to be fried burrata cheese, but its just those tiny pieces there. This dish was okay.
Seared Foie Gras
White Truffle Risotto - This was my first time having truffle. They came out with a wooden box and opened it showing off their collection of truffles, then loaded my dish with freshly shaved white truffle. I always thought that truffles were supposed to taste amazing, but they actually don't really have a taste. Its the smell of them that makes it sooooo good. It is so fragrant, that even when you eat the food, the scent travels up your nasal passage and is just amazing. I couldn't get enough of it. I kept inhaling my plate. Totally worth the extra $65.
I forgot what kind of fish it was, but the crispy skin made the dish for me.
Sonoma Lamb Chop - This was surprisingly not that good.
Pont L'eveque tart - cheese filled tart with honey yummmmmmm
Chocolate - always good.
green apple, pomegranate, dandelion & Burdock soda - there was frozen bits of apple and apple sorbet that melted in my mouth. This is the best fruit dessert dish I've ever had.
Just some after dinner sweets

If you really want to impress your date, take him/her here. This restaurant is perfect for a romantic dinner.

"When a restaurant gets its first Michelin star it will become popular and everyone will love it. When a restaurant gets its second star, every guest that comes will come to criticize every little detail about the dining experience, and that is what I did.

The food for the most part was delicious. I had a tasting menu of smoked salmon (ordinary), crispy rock shrimp cake with Osetra Caviar (pops in your mouth surprise), and rolled goat with Grape and Chopped Pistachios (delicious).

Then we had our second course which was an egg caviar which was delicious. The decor was wonderful and the taste was a bit strange at first then comforting.

Third, we had my favorite dish of the night, Corn Ravioli with Maine Lobster. It was such a great texture of chewy and soft added with the powerful taste of both that blended so well together.

Fourth, I had the Chef's Daily Fish Selection. So this was the most interesting of them all because the fish entree came out with all the scales still on the fish..but it was used for decoration and eating. I have to say..that even though it looked cool...it was crunchy and the fish could have done better without it.

The Fromage was ordinary and did not stand out although it was good. Forgettable basically.

Lastly came the Sticky Toffee Pudding with Mocha Malt Ice Cream and Red Berry-Hibiscus Conssomme. I never was a fan of sticky pudding and this did not change my mind at all. The ice cream was the only thing I was really a fan of..

The reason why I gave this restaurant a three was because the service was HORRIBLE. After working at a fine dining restaurant you notice a lot of mistakes that are stupid mistakes that a NEW person should only make. Especially from a TWO michelin star restaurant, I would expect them to be trained to, serve ladies first, know which food belongs to which seat, serve clean wine glasses, know which glasses belong to which customers, be able to give mediocre wine suggestions, and so on..which this restaurant failed to do.

Overall.. you might want to rethink the ONLY two michelin star restaurant in LA area."
"Parking: Street but a little difficult. Free street parking after 6 but check signs

Price: $$$$ Was it worth the price? I am sure the food was very high quality but the food itself... is it worth $400 for two? SUPER questionable

Went for DineLA 's restaurant week. $99+ per person.

to drink: a complimentary MELON SODA. very light and not too sweet with a dash of puree

Started with a stone FRUIT SALAD.
it was a slice of plum, peach, and some florals/greens. In a saucy vinegar with a hint of sesame oil -- hellll yeah i tasted that.
It was refreshing and delicious!! Was it even worth $5? The portion was pretty tiny.

Next was the bread, they had a beautiful platter of different styles of bread. I really liked that the breads held the flavor well.
I had the PLAIN BRIOCHE -- MUST HAVE. It was like a croissant.
BASIL BRIOCHE - i like basil and this tasted just like it. It had a croissant texture with a very herby flavor.
OLIVE BREAD - all crust which I don't like. Very rustic and had the iron taste olives do. I don't like crust but if this is what floats your boat, go for it.
Bacon bread - another rustic bread with a smokey bacon (not crispy flavor).

TOMATO SOUP with Raspberry sorbet: this was a fun experimental dish but it really was just plain tomato soup. The sorbet and soup itself blended into a room temperature dish.

TRUFFLE RISOTTO (extra $75 for supplement): I personally like this dish. It was creamy with a quarter truffle shaved on top. I now know what truffle alone tastes like.... It has a light flavor and i think no matter how much of it you put.. It'll always reach a standard of flavor. No more, no less. I love the texture and density where it wasnt a little hard and had less give. think purposely undercooked long grain rice.

BRAISED PORK BELLY was awesome. It had a tangy sauce over it with a carrot puree. Even though it was considered braised, it wasnt dry at all!!!

Dessert: CARAMEL POPCORN WITH CHOCOLATE MOUSSE. --- nah man, this was a stretch for me. the bottom of the cup held a goop of caramel and there was one popcorn that wasnt a popcorn. it was crumbs with caramel shaped into regular popcorn on top of a thin dark chocolate bridge. i didnt enjoy this and it was just too much at once.



Would i go again? No, but it is worth a shot if you have extra cash lying around. Don't save up for this."
"This is my second time dining at Melisse and compared to the first time it blew it away. I came here compliments of a friend and we went all out. We had the Ten without the book along with some added benefits.

I will let your palate decide if its worth it, but being moved up from a Michelin 1 star from when I first visited was a pleasant surprise. I have been to several Michelin 1 star and 2 star restaurants and this was treat no matter if its your first or your umpteenth time.

The service is impeccable, we were constantly asked about bread, water, cleaning of the table (yes I eat bread messy), after each course it was always cleaned off. I made stain on the white table linen and they covered it with a white sticker. We started off with our ten courses and at about the 6th you start feeling it especially with a wine pairing. Upon our arrival we were seated in the main seating area and were offered champagne or wine. My friend doesn't drink wine, so they offered her champagne instead. Each dish was presented in a white dish with the accents of the food. Every dish was explained in full detail (something which can run over your head after so many), but its nice and it adds to the professionalism.

We saw that several patrons were celebrating birthdays or anniversaries and Melisse presents them with small gift boxes of a chocolate or something like that. In addition they leave cards wishing those patrons greetings on your special day. That's really nice especially for being attentive to the special occasion.

Two things of note, if you get anything with the truffle, they bring the truffle box along with the shaver and shave them fresh. This is something I rarely see. The sommelier was excellent in complimenting the wine with the dish, I had two glasses that complimented my meat dish and my fish dish. I know this is his job, but his choices were the best I have had in a long time.

The icing on the cake was that Josiah Citrin came out to greet us and ask us how the meal was. I didn't take a picture with him, but to meet the man behind the scene was great. I also met the sommelier and another manager by the name of Kevin and all were great. My sibling makes it a point to come here on her anniversary and that says a lot, they have been going there from OC for the last 6 years and love celebrating it there.

If you have the money to spend, I would say do this place for a special occasion. Its worth the price and the ambience and can be very romantic. Do dress up when you go here, because dress up dinners are a good thing once in a while (at least business casual)."
"This well overdue and excited to come back this year again! Prepare to embark on a gastronomic adventure like no other at Melisse, where every dish is a masterpiece crafted with precision and passion. From the moment you step into this Michelin-starred sanctuary, you are welcomed with unparalleled hospitality and an ambiance of refined elegance.

The journey begins with a chartreuse-tinted welcome beverage, a delightful concoction of vodka, Japanese peach, yuzu, almond syrup, and St-Germain--a perfect introduction to the symphony of flavors that awaits.

The culinary symphony unfolds with a series of canap√©s, each more exquisite than the last. The Aged Beef with Green Goddess, Charcoal, and Caviar is a sensory delight, with wagyu tartare nestled within airy charcoal puffs, elevated by the sharp salinity of golden Ossetra and shiso blossoms.

The Sweet Corn with Truffle Cream crackers are a harmonious blend of sweetness and musk, a testament to Chef Josiah Citrin's mastery of flavor combinations.

The Chef's riff on the Catalan staple of pa amb tom√†quet, featuring a tart tomato jelly, captures the essence of tradition with a modern twist, while the Teardrop-shaped Cheese and Crackers marry the richness of Gouda with the sweetness of bourbon sabl√©.

Each dish is thoughtfully paired with exquisite wines, such as the 2008 Philippe Gonet Champagne Grand Cru 'Cuv√©e Belemnita' Blanc de Blancs, which accentuates the flavors of the canap√©s with its intense toastiness and luscious orchard fruit notes.

As the journey continues, guests are treated to a trio of amuse bouche, each showcasing the versatility of tomato. The King Crab with XO Sauce delights with its sweet-savory interplay, while the Coal-kissed Sawara with Tomatillo and Shiso offers a symphony of textures and flavors.

The Uni Cromesquis is a playful rendition of Santa Barbara uni, with its sweet salinity complemented by the creamy richness of the croquette--a true delight for the palate.

The culinary journey reaches its crescendo with the Liberty Duck 'Rouennaise', a 21-day aged masterpiece infused with sweet spice and served with plum condiment, shiso, and onion farci--a symphony of flavors that dance on the tongue.

For dessert, the Peach Tart with Vanilla Mousseline and Yuzu is a fitting finale, with its buttery crust and rich stone fruit flavors leaving a lasting impression.

As the evening draws to a close, guests are left with memories of a culinary experience unlike any other--a testament to Melisse's commitment to excellence and innovation in every dish. Truly, a culinary symphony to remember."
"C.H.E.F.S North Cal vs. So Cal Foie Battle $211.99 per individual six-course prix fixe dinner (with wines) to support sustainable farming practices and the battle for Foie Gras!

Great dining experience! Service was superb!

I was O.D. on Foie Gras!!! The rest of my party (3) was all Foie Gras OUT!!

I kind of knew about it coming into it....

The chefs had prepared all sorts of foie gras: very fancy schmancy... from terrine of foie gras and foie gras parfait to seared foie gras and foie gras tortelloni, lastly we had foie gras ice cream.. good god!!! My favorite was the simple seared foie gras, the rest was too moussey and buttery.

I really enjoyed all the 7 different wines, refresh my palate for more and more and more foie gras coming.

Finally as we were taking a breather, a plate of macaroons came out and the waiter announced that they're foie gras Macaroons. OMG, I'm glad I signed the petition at the beginning of the night because by this time I didn't care whether it was going or staying. Don't get me wrong, I very much enjoy the simple foie gras dish.

When we arrived, there were 3 cop cars hanging on the sidewalk, when we were leaving, there were 2 news van just outside the restaurant. But we had a nice time and FOIE GRAS out!!

So I guess this is the perfect time to say ""au revoir"" to Foie Gras!"
"A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Spectacular! FAB-ulous! So far I have not found any better within the greater Los Angeles area for this class of a restaurant. I've dined at MIchelin - rated restaurants all over Europe, Monaco in particular was a special memory.... the Bar & Boeuf by Alain Ducasse. Once you've savored the delightful treats Alain Ducasse teases & tempts you're discerning palate with, one is immediately smitten and if I had the choice, money not being an object, I would consistently patronize Alain Ducasse restaurants solely but alas! I do not have the funds.

Melisse happens to be A++ on SERVICE. They really know how to do everything. Never leaving the plate on the table too long when you are done with a particular dish. They made sure that we were always poured...just to the right level in the class with our selection of wine.

A+ on their WINE LIST

A+ on the food and wine pairings

B+ on size of food selections. This is the only ""beef"" I have with them. When you select a 10 course meal, typically this screams ""small portions...VERY small portions"" but I felt they could have spared at least one more mouthful of every dish that I selected. It was TOO tiny. Or maybe it could be that the food was so delish that I just wanted more of it! who knows?

A+ on their VALET service. very CHEAP (and there is nothing cheap about this place)

After paying the tab of $480 including tip, my BF and I walked out of there feeling only slightly ripped off....we could have had more to eat, we didn't leave hungry but satisfied.

We will go there again."
"My husband made a reservation for my birthday as we read a lot of great reviews.

What a disappointment.

We thought of going to Providence like last year, or go to Studio at Montage in Laguna Beach, but since we have never tried this restaurant, we thought we would give it a try.
First, when we walked into the restaurant, the hostess just looked at us with a flat affect. Later, my husband and I both agreed that she appeared to be rather rude; definitely not welcoming. I asked him, "" Is it the French thing??""
Then our head waiter appeared; also very serious and subdued. So, I had to ask my husband again, ""Is it the French thing??""

We ordered from regular course meal. I had wagyu tartar, lobster bolognese, then Wagyu.
My husband had the Egg Caviar, Halibut, then NY steak.

Nothing was bad. But there was nothing memorable about it. I hate to compare, but I cannot help comparing to the experiences we've had at Providence or at The Dining room with Chef Craig Strong... Those meals, with each course were full of wonder and delight. Spectacular experiences. This meal we had at Melisse do not even come close to any of the meals we've had at either Providence, the Dining room or others.

If you are foodie, and enjoy true sense of culinary art, I cannot recommend this restaurant.

From the greetings, to meal, and price, I would give only 2 stars.
With this price, we could had much better meal somewhere else, and also treated with smiles and warm welcome.

And service was fine; but not exceptional, rather mechanical.

Everything about this restaurant lacks 'heart'."
"Couldn't think of a better place for a complete foie gras dinner as the day of the ban finally hits. Not sure if I'm more ecstatic about the foie dinner or saddened that CA has banned the sales of foie. Sure you can still find restaurants selling the delicacy but are they willing to fork out the hefty fine?

Not sure why it took me so long to make reservations as the only time available for Fri night was at 9:45. Was able to find street parking and was immediately seated as we walked in. It was a no brainer for us as we were here for one reason...FOIE GRAS. Glad to see that they still offered their regular menu as well.

Started off with the usual amuse bouche http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2wg_JVCISbqgapfOqadEFA?select=xq8-B8h6olaGC9LQiC2KhQ#fxyFE8BiwfIeGfIgi0I4qA. The bottom grape is covered with pistachios and goat cheese and the top one gives patrons an introduction to molecular gastronomy, as it literally bursts in your mouth.

Bread was also brought over and I selected my usual bacon and basil brioche.

The meal first started with the foie gras cromesquis http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2wg_JVCISbqgapfOqadEFA?select=xq8-B8h6olaGC9LQiC2KhQ#vCKrSOgToyPc5x69nHJBbQ. Basically foie gras breaded and fried into a croquette. It was still warm as they brought it to our table and upon biting into you, the foie inside literally gushes out and leaves a mild foie taste on in your mouth. It was the perfect start to an awesome meal.

Next up...foie gras royale http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2wg_JVCISbqgapfOqadEFA?select=xq8-B8h6olaGC9LQiC2KhQ#7FYUvnlkC4YLnN9wq2rj5g. Each time we dine here, we are brought some sort of mousse like starter. Tonight was no different as they served us this foie gras royale which had layers of blackberry gelee, foie gras flan, and brown butter mousse. The sweetness of the blackberry gelee and the saltiness of the brown butter mousse were perfectly paired with the foie gras flan. Wished they served this in a bigger glass!

Terrine of foie gras http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2wg_JVCISbqgapfOqadEFA?select=xq8-B8h6olaGC9LQiC2KhQ#Km2IWgknjHj-acPTP-e1kw. Served with a warm piece of toasted brioche bread, the terrine had the perfect consistency and cherry sauce added a nice sweetness.

Truffled foie gras agnolotti http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2wg_JVCISbqgapfOqadEFA?select=xq8-B8h6olaGC9LQiC2KhQ#NrsoZBVDBuwqgN_bHjZmXw. Probably my favorite dish of the night. The vegetalbes were perfectly cooked and offered a nice texture contrast to the beautiful agnolotti. The agnolottis were filled with of course, foie! These little pillows of pasta were simply AMAZING! I could've skipped the rest of the dishes to come and to just have a bowl of this. Yes it really was that good!!!

True day boat scallops 'rossini' http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2wg_JVCISbqgapfOqadEFA?select=xq8-B8h6olaGC9LQiC2KhQ#QwPyXMC5G45izij2MGZiJg. Perfectly seared and seasoned. The mushroom sauce on the left was nothing short of spectacular. Dab a little onto your scallop and add a piece of truffle on top for a mouth watering trip to heaven.

Foie gras w/ dover sole http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2wg_JVCISbqgapfOqadEFA?select=xq8-B8h6olaGC9LQiC2KhQ#V8GE88M2bmFczWjZLbONOQ. The perfectly cooked piece of dover sole paired with generous portion of foie on top of a corn polenta (?). At this point in th meal, I was in a sensory overload and forgot what the waiter said.

Liberty duck breast http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2wg_JVCISbqgapfOqadEFA?select=xq8-B8h6olaGC9LQiC2KhQ#dycVKg6qjW9CuL19sUaLXQ. Of course cured foie gras was shaved table side and the contrast in temperature between the warm duck breast and the foie was amazing.

As if there wasn't already enough foie for the night, Chef Takayama created a strawberry foie shortcake along with a foie ice cream http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2wg_JVCISbqgapfOqadEFA?select=xq8-B8h6olaGC9LQiC2KhQ#KDjsyT5qQbqg7BU6odIJNA. Sounds a little weird you say? Yes but holy crap was the foie ice cream good. The strawberry foie shortcake was made using lady fingers and filled with a strawberry foie mousse. The perfect way to end an awesome dinner.

If that wasn't enough, our waiter brought out even more desserts compliements of both Ryan and Chef Takayama http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2wg_JVCISbqgapfOqadEFA?select=xq8-B8h6olaGC9LQiC2KhQ#go8YwxrB9oSAqYprH4a4JQ. Sadly enough, we did find out that the banana mousse was discontinued and replaced with this date mousse. It was awesome but I do have to admit my heart goes to the banana mousse which was served with their chocolate souffle. Hope Chef Takayama decides to bring it back one day!!

Mignardises http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2wg_JVCISbqgapfOqadEFA?select=xq8-B8h6olaGC9LQiC2KhQ#n0TLMYmREopeixRuC3HGiA and fresh fruit http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2wg_JVCISbqgapfOqadEFA?select=xq8-B8h6olaGC9LQiC2KhQ#X79_ZPQUVVVjhx5AR2P2Iw were also brought out to end an awesome evening."
"I was here back in January for Dine in LA. This place was simply amazing. There was a little bit of a back up in the kitchen and the waiter did a splendid job of entertaining us with the history of the restaurant and the chef to keep us from getting restless. The food was also superb, will return soon."
"It's official ya'll! I'm in love with Melisse'. Shiieeet. This restaurant is simply enchanting. The food is utterly mesmering, the tastes are beguiling. The plates are coursed out like a string of multifarious pearls dancing along the ridges of your tongue and tastebuds, leaving you blissful and sated."
"Melisse is one of the finest restaurants in LA and is a great place for special events. I've been there for romantic dinners with the wife and also for special events with larger wine tasting groups and every time, they never cease to impress. Pricey yes, but worth it for a memorable dining experience."
"3.5 stars So coming in from San Francisco, my first impression was pretty subpar for a Michelin Star restaurant. The decor is dated and needs some sprucing up, it's very 90's. I can't help but notice the decor, it's the designer in me!

Moving onto the food, we got the 7 course tasting menu and the meal was well paced and good, but I guess I was expecting to be blown away. The egg caviar and truffle risotto were my favorites, but could pass on all the others. The steak was a bit bland surprisingly. I would probably not come back but glad I tried it out."
"My husband took me here for our 2 year wedding anniversary this year and it was wonderful. They put us in the small quiet room with a fireplace in it. Very nice. I've never really had french food, but this was really great. The prices were expensive, but it was worth it for the experience alone. I love 3 hour dinners. We enjoyed the tasting menu, and the presentation of the food, and the service was great. My favorite part was the dessert! Chocolate, Chocolate, Chocolate....WOW! It was SOOOO good. I'll have to update this later with the food we ordered."
"I don't feel worthy to review this place, but let's just say, as someone who has been to a few Michelin star restaurants here in California and in NY, this place definitely lives up to those same standards and deserves a star. The service is unreal, and when they learned it was my birthday a week earlier, they gave me a little gift and a birthday candle. Very charming touch. We got the $145 menu with no upgrades and we left completely satisfied. After drinks our total was over $500, so this is not the kind of place you go once a week (although I don't doubt there are people in L.A. that could afford to), but for a special treat ( and with a gift certificate our relatives gave ), this place was perfect. The food was innovative and delicious. I highly recommend at least one visit here during your lifetime."
"Probably the best meal I've had in ages -- Melisse is a two star Michelin restaurant and rightly so! We ordered the tsar nicoulai caviar which did not disappoint. At $140 it is their top of the line caviar which was served with mini potato pancakes that were done very skilfully. Theceviche which was light, refreshing and citrusy. After that came their truffle tagliatelle house made pasta which was singularly the most delicious plate of pasta I've ever had. They gave a generous serving of shaved black Italian truffle presented in a gorgeous plate ( see below). For entrees i had the lobster pasta which also had truffle inside and the lamb chops both of which were delectable. The service was excellent and the wine sommelier there was very knowledgeable. What a treat to dine here ! I will definitely be back!"
"This is long overdue.. Have eaten here in Melisse at least maybe 8 times.. and all experiences were amazing! This is one of my favorite fine dining experiences. The service is always great and the food never disappoints! Even with Covid protocols, they still try to make sure you get the best experience."
"This place is over-rated compared to the best high-end restaurants in New York or even Salt Lake City. Yes, that's right. Salt Lake City.

The sommlier seemed like he was not quite there.

Great service otherwise.

The food was a total disappointment. I didn't even have to pay but I was pretty let down."
"I thought this was a unique dining experience. The staff was great and the restaurant ran so well. We loved watching everything happen and the communication between the staff to make everything run so well was so fun to watch. Really beautiful service. The wine was fantastic as well. I have to say that my husand and I were not overly impressed with the food. It was just ok in my book. Dinner for the two of us was $750 all in and while I'm glad we went for the experience, service and wine, I would probably not go back because the food was not exceptional."
"Husband and I came here for their ""Dine Melisse"" special, which consisted of a five course tasting menu.

The food was good, but could have been better. One of my complaints is the bread. I expect for a restaurant of this caliber to have warm bread, not room temperature. That was somewhat disappointing. Another complaint I have was that the service was only okay. I felt that the servers could have come around more frequently; also one of the wait staff almost spilled coffee on me. He apologized. A complete accident, but no one came (one of the servers) to check to see if there was anything that could have been done or if I was okay. Last, the Wagyu beef dish I had was only so-so.

Overall it's an okay restaurant. I definitely think that Providence is much more consistent and their staff is more attentive."
"This will be expensive, no matter what you order. However, it'll be worth it.

Took my fiancee there for his birthday, and we indulged in the 10 course tasting menu with the wine pairing. The food was divine, and the waitstaff was very very nice. The tasting menu does very, but they do have some popular dishes that remain, namely the Lobster Bolognese, and the Egg Caviar. The seared Foie Gras was delicious, as was the Wagyu beef. I didn't much care for the kanpachi.

My only (very mild) compliant was that the wine and dishes were not timed as well as they could. Sometimes we were waiting several minutes for either one to arrive. I know it's a minor thing, but when you're trying to be up there with fabulous places (and steep prices) as French Laundry or locally, Providence, this stuff should be ironed out."
"I got taken to Melisse as a treat for both my birthday and as a farewell-to-LA dinner. I figured I should go out with a bang!

This restaurant has the best meal that I've had in LA, no doubt. It is only topped for my all-time favorite meal by Le Cirque in LV, but that's another review for another time...

So.. the food.. mmmmmmmm. We had the fixed price menu but what was nice is that unlike other places, they let us each pick from a few items for each course (instead of like at some other places where everyone at the table has to have the same thing). Nice.

Two amuse bouches!? sweet. I have to try and reproduce that grapes encrusted with goat cheese and pistachios dish..
Since I'm a sucker for fois gras, I had to have that as the appetizer and it did not disappoint. The main dish - rabbit, full of flavor and spices and also served with a rabbit bodoin sausage which was a great compliment to the meat rather than an afterthought (like I have had at other places). And dessert? How can you say no to something called 'chocolate chocolate chocolate'? :D Check my pics for the dishes mentioned.

Service was great, ambiance was great, and hey, it wasn't even that far from my house. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to celebrate something special - including celebrating a love for good food. ;)"
"The food was very good- I found it inventive. I'm withholding two stars because for the prices, the service should be seamless: elegant, low key but attentive to every detail. I've been to a couple of magical places - the French Laundry for one. Melisse charges the same. Like French Laundry, the menu is prix fixe with literally two options where the customer has a choice. Our ""chief server"" - I hesitate to call her waitstaff as she was dressed in a suit and had brooches and flair that seemed to signify some higher credentialing- whipped out a ratty ordering pad to jot down our choices like we're at Denny's. I have never seen that in a restaurant as nice as this. Certainly a server can remember two options? Unfortunately, it was consistent with her original presentation of the menu which was more of a Friday's ""you got your bigger portions here if you wanna be real full"" style rather than an elegant, simple explanation. I found it crass frankly. I don't know if it were her alone or if all the staff were like that, but it made me and my date uncomfortable, her talking about what to order if we wanted to ""feel full"" when we left. The stars would be lower if the food weren't so good- the management should demand of their staff the same standards as Thomas Keller does with his staff. The people ranking below the chief server, mind you, were impeccable. They were gracious and elegant and left the plates until we were both through with the course. Higher training is a must for the lead servers, however, if they don't want to continue to detract from the experience."
"Came back after a few months to enjoy a new menu. What a great experience once again. Spectacular food, spectacular wine, spectacular service!! Both Josiah and Ian were involved with the service which was very cool and Matthew and Fernando were just wonderful. See you in a few months for a bran new menu."
"This is one of those restaurants where you expect an experience, not just a meal.

Go for the tasting menu and have the sommelier recommend some booze-juice to go with your meal.

When all is said and done, you'll be expecting a food coma to go with your fatty bill (but trust me: it's worth every penny)."
"First, I guess I should say that I am French and very picky (Or does it come with the territory? ;)). I also know that you get what you pay for and in this case the $500 for three (wine and tip included) was definitely worth it.
All three of us had the ""Tasting Menu"" and absolutely everything we had was delicious and extremely flavorful. My friends were delighted. The service was fantastic: the staff was always very attentive, courteous, helpful and patiently explaining everything on the menu to my non-French guests. We had a culinary blast and I am pretty sure that the evening will be engraved in our memory for quite a while. Not only because of the great food but the ambience, the tasteful d√©cor, the laughter and the feeling of togetherness we shared that night. Priceless.
Merci M√©lisse et √† bient√¥t!"
"I do agree with many people that the dishes served at Melisse weren't ""memorable"", but that did not make anything less than exceptional. From my point of view, the reasons why I don't remember the dishes were because everything was excellent (minus one nasty dish) and because everything was so complex that my simpleton mind would not remember it all even if I tried.

My friend and I both tried the Ten menu, which was amazing! I'm not even going to try to explain what each course was. I will just say I would recommend this place and tasting menu if you have the disposable income as the bill came out to be 485 ex tip. They also charge you for the nicer ingredients too (e.g. if you wanted truffles, it was extra $$$), which we did get.

The atmosphere is nice too. Very classy. The pictures of its exterior does not do it justice. It looks a lot nicer in person.

Overall -0.5 stars because I felt the waiters acted as if they were better than you. Other -0.5 stars because there was a 3% healthcare tax on my bill *squints at bill*. Seriously?! I honestly believe this is a purely political statement as they could have easily priced the the ~$15 I was charged into the menu. Regardless of my political affiliations, I do not appreciate Melisse jamming their agenda down my throat at my dinner.

This place is really bougie. I wouldn't come here for a romantic dinner; it's more of a place to live life on the wild side and have fun. I'd probably recommend the steakhouse, CUT, in Beverly Hills if you're looking for date night.

With all that said, French Laundry- here I come!"
"We recently came as we were fortunate enough to get seating times on a Saturday night on the weekend that I was visiting LA soon after the reopening. I loved the intimacy of Melisse compared to the more hustling and bustlng atmosphere of Citrin. It's a really great contrast depending on what kind of vibe you're looking for. (The new Citrin is gorgeous by the way!)

First and foremost, I really appreciated how approachable and down to earth Josiah Citrin was during our meal. He stopped by our table to chat in the beginning and then again at various times throughout the meal and that was one of the most enjoyable parts!

Now, the food -
1. Melisse is definitely a seafood forward restaurant and even though I'm not the biggest fan of seafood, it was enjoyable to try all the dishes!
2. Favorites: Wagyu beef tartare ""beggar's purse with caviar, bluefin tuna with seaweed chip, uni with black truffle bite (SO GOOD, I wish I could eat this again and I literally was previously the biggest hater of uni), Chestnut soup with whipped black truffle (so creamy and flavorful), Kinmedai, Lamb Tagliatelle Pasta (FAVORITE dish of the night)
3. BOTH desserts at the end of the meal were fantastic - I would say the best desserts I've had compared to the other 2 Michelin star restaurants in LA
4. Just so-so: I felt like my Hokkaido scallop dish was cooked unevenly - more rubbery and hard on one half and less overcooked on the other half. This was the first time I've tried pigeon and I'm not a fan of it so far - my pigeon dish was very hard and tough to chew - not sure what's it's really supposed to be like though but when I previously tried squab, the meat was softer.

Overall, a super excellent experience at Melisse. Highly recommended if you're looking for an intimate, classic dining experience. Prepare to spend about 3 hours here!"
"Read the Michelin reviews and went to try their famous tasting dinners. The first thing I noticed was that the valet did not look like a valet at all, dressed in a trim fitting fashionable leather jacket and pants. Service charge for the valet is $8.50, which is just a scam to get you to give them $10 and keep the change... really... I would rather they just charge the $10 upfront. What's the difference?

So, onto the service and food... they are very friendly folks, but for the price you are paying, they should be doing your laundry while you eat, or at least make your bed.

So, the 4 course menu sounded good, because I thought the 10 course was going to be too much food. The price difference was only $30 for the 4 versus 10, but I know I couldn't finish the 10, evne though I wanted to try it.

They brought out the amuse bouche of the cheese tomato and the giant clam and cucumber froth. Then I ordered the Wagyu tartare, lobster linguini, flatiron steak, and chocolate chocolate chocolate desert.

The tartare was sublime! The beef was made into a paste, almost, and you eat it with a rice cake that looks like a Rice Krispie treat, but it's salted. Very good flavor, but not overwhelming, as some other steak tartares with the heavy sauces.

The lobster linguini came out in a rectangular lump with a white bubbly froth covering. Looked almost like a frosted over cake almost. But the froth is actually truffle oil and it really complimented the taste of the lobster. You just use your fork to section off the rectangle and eat it in bite sized chunks. Great flavor and delicated balanced with the tomato sauce which plays off the truffle.

Now, the flat iron steak... I think it was about 2 oz. and came out in 1 strip, which appears tiny when you are used to the 10-16 oz. supersized steaks in other places. But it's not the size that matters, but the taste. This steak was beautifully cooked, no hint of oiliness anywhere, and the carrot paste and taro pastry compliment the earthy flavor of the steak. The dish also contained a bite sized morsel of beef which had the consistency of a slow braised roast. It almost just melts in your mouth.

Lastly, the dessert... oh my... chocolate ice cream, chocolate mousse with caramel, and the finale... a chocolate souffle with the chocolate filling injected by syringe in front of your face to ensure it doesn't get all soggy and soaked into the pastry... I usually don't like souffles but I finished this one. Being a chocolate fiend... I could not say no. They also brought out a finishing plate of various desserts like macarones, more chocolates, fruit jelly (DELICIOUS!), strawberries, cookies, etc.

I was so stuffed that I wanted to walk around a bit before I got back in the car... the tables around us went with the 10 course and they were there before us and they were still there after we left... if you order that, be prepared for a long but extravagant dining experience.

Would I come here all the time? No... but I would definitely come here for special occasions when I want to indulge myself a bit and enjoy a slow, refined, dining experience."
"It's a pretty good environment, but the door is hard to find as there is no big sign around. The parking is valet with $8.5. Food is ok. The caviar and foie gras are nice. I like the dessert as well. I would say, the 10 courses meal is too much for me. Lessen the portion and number of courses may be nice."
"What is not to love about this place? If you want dinner to be an experience, and not just dinner, Melisse is perfect. We've come here a few times for special occasions. Their tasting menu is always changing so you never know what you're going to get. And that's half the fun. I can't wait to go back soon!"
"How could a restaurant with impeccable service and presentation, and understated but elegant flavors, send me out the door with a frown on my face?

In a word - politics.

The management has chosen to pass their irritation at a recent employee health care requirement on to their guests in the form of a 3% surcharge on the bill. So my final impression of Melisse was not the lovely complimentary six flavors of sweets along with the bill, but rather a grouchy hand reaching into my pocket to make a political statement that has no place in a hospitality establishment.

The menu had a lovely quote about, IIRC, a host being responsible for the happiness of the guest from beginning to end of their visit. How does that square with making the guest, not the host, responsible for the happiness of the host's employees?"
"We had dinner here a few weeks ago with friends. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it either, but it definitely did not live up to the hype (or the $700+ tab for 4 people).

First of all, the waiter (or ""Assistant"" as he preferred to be called... he curtly informed us that he was not a ""waiter"" but, rather, ""I am one of Josiah 's (chef) assistants..."" Sure, whatever) informed us that nobody was allowed to order off a la carte from the menu if anybody chose a tasting menu... it would screw up timing on the meal and/or make it too tough for the kitchen.

I had to go with the vegitarian tasting menu because everything else was wild game (I'm just not that into venison)...

Food comes in multiple tiny courses amid very theatrical presentation. Because of the multiple course thing, we were there for three hours which got to be a little too long for my taste.

Another problem I had was the decor. The dining room is brightly lit, which calls your attention to the fact that the place looks like an airport lounge (think ""LAX Red Carpet Club"").

All in all, the food was very good and the service was over the top. But-- for my personal taste only-- I think I'll skip it next time and go to someplace that is a little less stuffy, less expensive, and that boasts a menu more in line with my obviously proletarian tastes!!!"
Fancy-schmancy and pricey. The food was excellent - truly high quality and magnificently prepared -- but the atmosphere felt dated to me. It lacked the energy of some of the other places I've been to in LA (that also serve amazing foods). It was a true fine dining experience and the service was impeccable.
"All the dishes are lovely, we especially loved the lobster bolognese.

However, I want to share one ""incident"" with you all yelpers. During the main course, they served a side of mashed potato for two of us to share. The mashed potato tasted good but it was on the salty side so we weren't able to finish it, but also didn't want to waste it. So we asked our waiter to box the mashed potato to go. His face turned stone, didn't know what to say, hesitated, and a few seconds later, bursted out ""maybe"" from his month.

I don't understand...is it because it's a high end restaurant and nobody cares to take the food home? But then there are people packing the sweets. Here in L.A. we take food home even when there are only few bites left...the way he responded really confused and disappointed us. I don't believe this is how a former 2-star michelin should serve their guests. And although our waiter tried to make it up by saying ""I will make sure they box it for you"", we didn't get the mashed potato at the end.

So, loved the food, but the service? not worth that price."
"It was time to put on my fancy pants again. This time for a date with Melisse, an elegant white tablecloth French restaurant in Santa Monica, and her alluring ten course prix fixe dinner. Kinda reminds me of a petite version of Joel Robuchon in Vegas but at a much more feminine scale. The dishes are sexy, petite, elegant, and beautifully presented with a touch of panache.

Whenever I go to modern French places like this, I tell myself to not nitpick every detail of every dish. I'm not a Top Chef judge or restaurant critic. I'm just a dude on the internet with enough free time to write some silly paragraphs about some stuff I ate.

Overall, I really enjoyed the stuff I ate and the experience I had at Melisse. The wine pairing of mostly minerally old world whites sent me on a road trip through various climates and terroirs of France. I highly recommended the pairing if you enjoy wine as it will give you time to sip, imagine, and converse in between dishes. I also opted for the seasonal Australian black winter truffles which are proudly presented to you at your table and liberally shaved onto your agnolotti.

So if you're feeling fancy and want another excuse to put those pants on, Melisse is one of the few gems in Los Angeles that caters to that fancy pants lifestyle you wish you could live every day. Thumbs up!"
"Atmosphere: 3.5/5, the AC is turned quite low so minus a few stars for that
Food: 3.5/5. The appetizers were quite good (quite similar to providence I would say), but the main meat dishes were fusion. And as an Asian, fusion Asian just tastes weird to me. Like specifically the Korean chicken leg and rice as well as the Cantonese tasting hen dish- I feel like authentic versions would taste better. The scallops were also extremely sour when paired with some sort of vinaigrette. And there was this icy grapefruit with liver that was like literally ice cold- which is strange to have in the middle of hot dishes. Overall I felt the food was a bit on the bland side.
Creativity: 5/5 presentation and the creativity in the food was what made it a two star Michelin I guess
Service: 5/5... which is expected for this price"
"This place has 2 Michelin stars!? Really?? Word of advice: Thompson at the thompson hotel is 9823740289734028 times better. Save your time and your taste buds and go there instead.

Melisse was good.. but not THAT good. My boyfriend took me to Melisse for our 100th day anniversary. The atmosphere was really pretentious and food overpriced. We ordered the regular tasting menu (which had like 50 dollar add-on options that were pretty ridiculous). Also, the waiter looked at us funny because we didn't order any wine or sparkling water.

It was fun tasting all the unique and different flavors but felt more like a science project with food than a romantic dinner. The dishes were not memorable enough for me to write about. Fortunately, my boyfriend and I had so much fun just talking. I give our conversation 5 stars."
Amazing place. We had the 10 year anniversary tasting menu (I think it was 10 courses in all) with the wine pairing. Everything that came out was delicious and the sommelier paired the wines perfectly. The service was outstanding and the restaurant exudes elegance. This is definitely a special occasion spot.
"Wow... Melisse is often voted as the best French restaurant in Los Angeles if not the best restaurant in LA period! This is only my third ** michelin star restaurant (after Spago and Providence) and Melisse bested both of those restaurants. The service is definitely better than Providence. Their dishes win on creativity and the seasoning and texture of each dish are on point. Right now they are still running their 10 year anniversary menu, which is $150 per person for 10 dishes. They also have their regular tasting menu for $105 per person for 4 dishes. However, if you go with one or more people, you each can order different dishes and try more than 10 dishes for that price. Lastly, they have their specialty menu, which is $200 per person for 13 dishes. I don;t think i could actually finish 13 dishes so my partner and I ordered the ala carte menu and we each ordered different dish so we can get variety of things.
Here is the breakdown:
Amuse bouche - two of them: first is a goat cheese covered grape. Mild goat cheese and an interesting texture to eat. Definitely a palate opener. Then came the second amuse: salmon mouse with orange marmalede and something else at the top. Very very tasty. Rich in taste but very light in texture.
First course:
Lobster bolognese for me and seared foie gras for my hubby. Both are excellent. The pasta in the lobster bolognese dish was al dente so provide a little but of crunch and the taste is just amazing, rich tomato taste with this shelfish broth on top. The seared foie gras was done perfectly and came with like 5 or 6 accompaniments all around the plate (ground pistachio, date jam, etc).
2. Truffle encrusted dover sole for me and Sea Bass for my husband - not much to say...all were tasty
3. Truffle Egg - we ordered an adidtional dish from their specialty truffle menu. This is why I think Melise trumps Ortolan, Sona, or Spago.... From the presentation of the dish, a gentleman came with a wood box, picked a whole black truffle and shave the whole truffle in front of you. Generous truffle portion but a hefty price to pay: $85 just for this one dish. It is very unique though...a ball of fluffy meringue egg white with the runny egg yolk in the center on top of this brown butter truffle jus....just amazing!
4. Venison for me (my first) and sonoma rack of lamb for the hubby. I didn't know what to expect with the venison, but it was not gamey at all. Cooked medium per my request and it came out perfect medium...and still juicy enough. Came with many different forms of sweet potato on the side. The rack of lamb (which i usually don't eat) was very good. It came with a side of lamb meatball that was moist and taste just like lamb in a good way.
5. Cheese cart for me ($15 supplement) and the chocolate, chocolate, chocolate for my hubby. The cheese cart was fun...and the selection was educational."
"Incredible restaurant. Amazing food, service and wine."
"Definitely one of the best dining experiences of my life. The food was amazing. We did the 10 and I have to say it did live up to the hype. The egg caviar was heavenly! Portions are large for a tasting menu. You will be full by the end of it. The wait staff was also excellent. If you get the chance to go, GO!"
"Budget-conscious beware--you won't find anything value-packed or super-sized in Josiah Citrin's elegant Westside favorite, M√©lisse. The chic but comfortable flower and sun-filled spot features classic French cooking with a California twist. Favorites include lobster bolognese with fresh cappellini, summer truffles, and basil; wild king salmon with asparagus, confit tomato, and truffle mousseline; and olive crusted lamb loin with Peruvian potatoes and jus d'agneau. Impeccable service and a noteworthy wine list make breaking your budget a little more tolerable."
"The space is small and intimate, and there aren't many tables, but you still feel like you have your privacy with your company and with the food/beverage experience. As a Michelin starred restaurant, the service was impeccable. I enjoyed discussing the wines and learning more from the somm. The food, overall, was amazing and scrumptious. Every bite had a thoughtful mix of textures and flavors, including combinations I haven't had before. I also really liked their dishes (the actual plates). I'm very glad I was able to get a reservation on my short visit to LA."
"Wonderful dinning experience, definitely hope to be back soon enough. Came here for a special occasion with my significant other and everything was wonderful! The food, the service, the ambience and of course the no cell phone policy! I cant say how annoying it is when I want to enjoy a night out dining and yet there are a bunch or rude and obnoxious people with there cell phones out. I am so glad this place does a wonderful job at imposing this rule. But needless to say I am a fan or fine dining/ foodie and this place did not disappoint!!! Loved every moment!"
"After reading the reviews on Yelp, Melisse was on my bucket list for over a year. I finally made time to go with a couple of my girlfriends. My horrible experience started from the moment we were greeted by the hostess. We had reservations and we still had to wait over 20 minutes. It was not a busy night at all. The service was horrible considering at such upscale restaurant you have at least 3 or 4 please waiting your table. The food was very disappointing, the only decent thing was the amuse bouche. At a restaurant like Melisse, you expect some reconstructed dishes or something out of the ordinary. Maybe this was just a bad day this restaurant was having but until I try it again I won't be able to give it anything more than 1 star. Not to mention the bill, which was $780 for the three of us (complete waste)!!"
"Went here with a good friend for dinner. WE wanted to have the carte Blanche menu, but we had a few dietary restrictions, and weren't sure if they would be accomodated. The fear was, they would simply omit those items, and not change the menu/dish, and we would have a sub par experience. Chef Citron came out himself, and said we have nothing to worry about.
So we had the carte blanche. Lots of hits, a few so so dishes... no misses except one. I love foie gras... I order it everywhere I go. One of the courses was a trio of foie... two of the three were amazing. The third was a poached foie, and it was served in the poaching liquid. It was horrible. It tasted extremely gamey, and the texture had become hard and grainey. It was bad. What a waste of a beautiful piece of foie.
All in all, best meal I have had in LA."
"It goes without saying that this restaurant is obviously very good, the ingredients are extremely fresh and the combination of flavors the chef creates is up with the best. Service is absolutely impeccable, very knowledgeable and attentive, yet not in your face. Why 4 stars? Well, we have eaten at a number very well rated restaurants, including other Michelin star restaurants in California and beyond, and the only down fall to Melisse is the price. We had their ""10"" tasting menu (10 courses plus amuse). They also offer a 4 course tasting menu, for relatively not much less so we went the whole shebang. All said and done, although the list price is $150, by the time you add tax and tip you're looking closer to $200 a head, or slightly more with a glass of wine each. Soooo..... although the food is amazing, the food is certainly not 2-3 times better than other high-end places, in that you can walk out for less than $100 a head at others (Route 246 in Solvang, or Bazaar at SLS....just for example). But, if you save your money up, or just wish to celebrate a nice occasion, I'd certainly recommend this restaurant if not just to say you have been.

Highlights for us were the Egg&Caviar, Lobster Bolognese, Crisp ""Japanese' Fish, Seared Foie Gras and the desserts were amazing, especially the apple gelato with pomegranate."
"LOVE. LOVE. LOVE.

If money grew on trees, I'd plant a bajillion acres of greenery just so I can wheelbarrow the stuff over to Josiah Citrin at Melisse and have him feed us every night. But money doesn't grow on trees, so I'm just going to have to keep Melisse on my short-list of favorite special occasion restaurants. Perfection costs a pretty penny. But if you have the dough and have never been to Melisse before, get the ""10"" - the chef's seasonal ten-course menu. Worth every penny. And then some.

A recap of our meal with a few extra lines about my favorites. Will star (*) my favorites...

1) Egg Caviar - lemon creme fraiche, american caviar, cremant de bourgogne, larochette. TO DIE FOR. I want to eat this everyday. With my eyes closed. AMAZING. MORE PLEASE. *

2) Spanish Blue Fin Tuna - forono beets, meyer lemon, walnut grenache reduction. So beautifully plated, and incredibly refreshing.

3) Artichoke Soup - violet artichoke, black truffle cromesquis. Waiter? A huge chunk of truffle is floating about in my soup. YEEEEES.

4) Seared Rougie Foie Gras - mcgrath farms turnips, blueberries, speculas, champagne gastrique. At my last supper, THIS is what I want to be served. This is the best piece of foie I've ever tasted. I closed my eyes during every other bite. I'm pretty sure the other diners thought I was a nut, but my husband understood. the blueberry compote/whatever was so wonderful paired with the foie. I didn't want this course to end........... *

5) Maine Lobster - fava beans, sweet peas, tetragon spinach, vanilla scented lobster nage. This dish looked better than it tasted. I was thrown off by the vanilla scented ""nage"". Felt like I was served a seafood dessert. Weird. But the plate was beautiful, and the textures were perfect.

6) Wild Red King Salmon - roasted purple carrot, ramps, purple potatoes, carrot nasturtium emulsion. Perfectly cooked piece of fish. Very pretty. Still trying to figure out what ""nasturtium"" is. Er, was. All I know is that I ate it.

7) Spring Lamb Loin - braised lamb shank, kohlrabi, morel mushrooms, natural jus. YUMMY!!! Lamb sometimes tastes like what I imagine B.O. (body odor) would taste like, but the lamb served at Melisse is to-die-for delicious. And that jus that was poured over my lamb loin tableside? SO lovely. *

8) Chantal Plasse Camembert - perigord truffle, shunkyo radish, chrysanthemum. Look, I love cheese, but I despised this course. It was a plate of everything I dislike. All the elements tasted soapy to me... The only low-light of the night.

9) Chocolate & Caramel Fondant - hazelnut crumble, valrhona abiano sorbet, mochaccino. AAAAAAAAH!!! Redemption! Amazing. I was smiling the whole time I was eating it. So was my tummy. *

10) Apple & Pomegranate. That's all it said on the menu... but in actuality, this final course was, in a nutshell, KICK-ASS. Desserts don't get more creative than this. I don't know how best to describe this final course other than... "" liquid nitrogen goodness"". This dessert was delightful and refreshing. Left me thinking, ""I'm the luckiest girl on the planet to have just enjoyed this ten-course, three-hour long meal."" Dude, if you can order this dessert, DO IT! Don't be fooled by the minimalist title. *

I'd give Melisse ten stars if I could, but I can't. Doesn't mean they don't deserve each and every one though. The food served to my hubby and I that night was orgasmically-delicious, and I look forward to returning to this fancy but not the least bit stuffy restaurant for all celebratory occasions between me and my hubby to come.

Hands down, the best culinary experience I've had in Los Angeles."
"MELISSE!!! My GAWD!!! All I can say is every bite was ORGASMIC. Totally blown away with the flavors and spice on every dish we ordered. There is NO taste that you can possibly think of that is comparable to what is mixing in your mouth. You just HAVE to be there to know what I'm talking about, literally... Lol"
"Of course a gem of Santa Monica - had a strange occurrence one anniversary evening when I walked my wife to the restroom before desert and when we returned to the table it had been cleared and my not so empty bottle of Chateau Montelena had been cleared as well. A bit off-putting but hey, we all make mistakes."
"People rave about this place. The food is terrific and beautifully presented. BUT it can be really hard to get the attention of the wait staff and the service was sooooo sloooow. We told them at the start we had limited time as we had to get back so our babysitter could leave, and they still took over 2 hours!"
"Yummmm food was delicious and service was spectacular. The atmosphere is more sophisticated (ie, providence) and less trendy (ie, the bazaar). I went on a Friday night and there were a lot of 40-something year olds wearing sports coats and suits. Dinner takes a looong time to arrive (the whole fine dining experience) so make sure to surround yourself with great company - we were here for 4 hours.

Regarding food, I recommend everything I tried: appetizer - (i) seared foie gras (ii) heirloom tomatoes; main course - prime strip loin; dessert - chocolate souffl√©."
"came here for engagement dinner. everything was awesome.

10 course tasting w wine pairing. did get a bit pricey but i'd say it was worth it.

my favorites were the ribeye, white mushroom, beef cheek dish, and the foie and gingerbread thing. everything was cooked perfectly and its really an eye opener when you get a small amount of everything on the plate to make the perfect bite.

that perfect bite happened in several of the dishes.

really cool inside, and great service. gave us free champagne and a small box of chocolate truffles which was a real nice touch."
"food: 5/5
service :4/5
atmosphere/decor: 2/5


I came here on a weekend night with reservations. The outside is very plain so its very easy to miss when you are driving by. When I entered, I was greeted by the nice hostess and lead to my table. I was a little disappointed when they lead me to the table right outside of the hostess stand, although I made very early reservations and noted this was for a special occasion. My table was right by the opening of the dinning room where all the guests had to walk through to get to their table. Being put here really decreased my dinning experience. Didn't complain because we already gotten our waters by the time tables opened up. Request a booth in your reservation if you have a party of 4 or smaller. The smaller alone tables (especially the 2 seaters) are really just tucked in anywhere they have space. Anyway, the food was very good but not the best I've had.

Sometimes one of our many waiters were not available and the food servers just gave us our food and mumbled what they were giving us. Some of the food servers don't speak completely fluent english, we had to guess what we were eating. Some of the food servers had such huge spanish accents I could not understand even after repeating. This didn't bother me because they were nice, it was just a little weird for this type of restaurant.

Uh, another thing. I guess babies and kids are welcome at this restaurant too. There was this family with two babies and they had all these formula bottles over the table. At least the parents took their kids out when they started crying."
"""To receive a guest is to take charge of their happiness during the entire time they are under your roof"" - Fernand Point

As I walked in, the whole environment changed. Dim lights, elegant decor, classy environment. I was at an upscale New York restaurant, except I was in LA.

They had 6 different types of bread and they were all unique and delicious!

dineLA menu

Stellar Bay Oyster
Peekytoe Crab, Burrata Cheese, Caper and Scallion Vinaigrette
One of the PRETTIEST plates I've ever seen. I'm not a fan of raw oysters, but I can eat this dish over and over again and be totally happy. It was creamy, rich, and full of flavor. The oysters were incredibly fresh, and the edible flowers added a nice aesthetic touch.

Savory Cabbage Potage
Potato, Leeks and Whipped Smoked Bacon
Sure, you might be thinking potage is just a soup. But believe me when I say, this was my FAVORITE dish of the night. The soup was out of this world and you NEED to dip your bread in this. Maybe, it was the crispy potato skin in the soup. Maybe, it was the bacon. It was probably the bacon....

Seared Maine Diver Scallop
Turnip, Mustard Greens, and Pea Tendril Broth
Vert
This scallop dish fell flat for me. No exciting flavors there. Wish it had some acidity to brighten up the dish.

Caramelized Chatham Bay Cod
Salsify, White Mushrooms and Chestnut Emulsion
I'm more of a salmon person. But I have to give credit because the cod cut like butter.

Flat Iron Steak
Braised Beef Cheek, Swiss Chard, Potato Galette, Shiitake Mushrooms, Sauce Bordelaise
The steak was good, but nothing memorable. However, the mashed potato was DIVINE. Loved the texture and one of my favorite, if not my favorite mashed potato I've ever had.

Sonoma Lamb Loin
Lamb Shank Ravioli, Braised Shelling Beans, Charred Onion, Rosemary Scented Lamb Jus
The lamb was a bit tough to cut. But I really enjoyed the ravioli. It was the perfect ravioli bite.

Chocolate and Caramel Fondant
Ricotta Cremeaux, Hazelnuts and Dulcey Ice Cream
I loved the white chocolate drippings on the side! The dulcey ice cream complimented the chocolate fondant. However, the hazelnuts weren't necessary for me in this dessert.

By the end of our meal, I was very satisfied by the amount of food we had. They also brought out two chocolate bite size desserts for us.

Thank you Melisse for your Two Michelin star experience!!"
"This place is pricey and the ambiance a little stuffy, but the food is excellent. I remember the steak had these salt crystals, which made the steak heavenly. I want to buy that salt and even asked them, but they did not sell it. I LOVE the cheese cart, the waiter asked what types of cheese I liked and he picked out 3 cheeses. To this day, and I went awhile ago, I still talk about that cheese plate. I had the tasting menu so my meal was almost 3 hours long. I ran out of things to say to my friend and we kinda sat there. Once I save up some money, I'm going back!"
"How this place stays in business at ridiculous prix fixe prices is truly mind blowing. Staffed to the gills, but have to ask for more bread, and ask for more butter, and ask for more water. Items come out too fast too slow. Food is just not good. The spot prawn was not a spot prawn at all. Who are you kidding? Smaller than a regular shrimp and tough as a shoe? Amuse bouche, so sweet and tart even a kid's popsicle would be more mellow. Everything covered in thick underwhelming sauces to mask their inferior quality. I was waiting for the curtain to fall and people to jump out yelling ""just kidding suckers""! Truly the only good thing about the experience was the tea at the end. That was it. Oh and the prices left one feeling like one got swindled out of a small investment. Winner of the worst restaurant in LA prize."
"I heard such great things about Melisse from the food to the experience that I went in to this dinner with really high expectations. Unfortunately they weren't met by the overall experience, especially considering the price.

We did the 10 course tasting menu. The food itself is incredibly well-prepared - beautiful, flavorful, intricately plated, etc. Really can't complain there. But at $150 per person + things like $35 extra charge for the truffle foam - it really should be more than just food.

Then with the service - multiple wait staff bringing your food and clearing it in harmony, a smooth opening/closing door to the back room/kitchen (rather than clanging/flapping). The sommelier was knowledgable and we appreciated his wine recommendations. All nice touches. But then the bussers are ironing the new table-clothes right next to you when they re-set the tables. A really classy restaurant would do that in the back.

Another example - there's a prominent ""no cellphones and no flash photography"" sign. Yet all the tables around us were full of folks on their phones the entire dinner or taking pictures of their food. It just felt out of place considering they were trying to achieve a high-degree of ambience and first-class service.

And did I mention you pay $8 for valet parking at the tiny lot next door? Not like you're pulling up to a red carpet place in a fancy section of town either. Valet should be included or the lot should be free.

I've been to a number of restaurants in Seattle, SF, New York and outside the US in this price-point, so I don't think it's out-of-place to expect all of these elements to fit together.

I really wanted to rate this more highly, but I just can't. Again, Yelp doesn't allow half-stars, but I'd rate this a 3.5 all things considered. Food - 5 stars; Service - 4 stars; Ambiance - 3 stars."
"I was going to come on to yelp and do a short review of my wonderful birthday dinner that I enjoyed last night but upon reading the write up of Beth L I feel I need to address that and defend the otherwise defenseless restaurant, chef, manager, waiter, ect. We were sitting close to this lady and heard both her and her date be more than rude to the waiter. At one point telling him ""we're drunk and if you don't go get our food now we're going to grab you and eat you"" who does that? And from there it just got more aggressive every time somebody went over to the table they loudly complained. All the while the waiter apologized. When the manager went over to apologize they cut him off saying that she was timing them now and the gentleman kept saying, ""you're better than this, you're better than this."" Finally when the chef appeared and discreetly went to the table we couldn't hear what was said but the reaction of this woman was like someone just told her a family member died. She gasped and moaned very loudly for a good 4-5 minutes trying to create a scene. She then got up still gasping and mumbling and stumbling her way out of the restaurant. I felt sorry for the staff.
Our experience was an amazing one! Who knew we would get a free show! Was the food taking a little between courses, yes it was, but we had decided when we were going to eat at Melisse that we wanted to stretch out the experience and enjoy our evening. If they had wanted speedy service I know there is a Denny's in Santa Monica as well. That's not a knock on Denny's but when you go to a fine dining place with multiple courses you should expect a long evening. I will definitely return to Melisse. The food (particularly the Foie Gras, the lobster, and the Waygu beef, oh and the chocolate) and service were both outstanding. The best we have experienced in LA."
"Once again I find my plebeian ass eating at a place where I clearly do not belong nor should I ever be associated with...but then again, fu*k all that noise, you only live once, let's eat some overpriced food!

Brought the wife here for our 10yr wedding anniversary dinner because anyone insane enough to deal with my dumbass for 10yrs deserves at least a decent meal every now and again. We had like a 10 course meal for $135 per person and shared a half bottle of bandol red wine for $55. So we're already talkin' $325 not including tax, tip or the 3% health care surcharge...total damage was just about 4 bills when all was said and done. Was it worth it? Kinda, sorta, not really? The place is beautiful, the food is great, service was amazing...but we had just had a very comparable meal at Patina in DTLA for about half the price, so there's that. Josiah Citrin was super nice btw and even stopped by and chatted for a bit, so, much respect.

Anyways I was trying to be courteous to the wife by not taking pictures of EVERY single course we had, hence the lack of pictures...so I blame the wife...and you should too.

PETIT FOURS

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m%C3%A9lisse-santa-monica-3#k_fghG7SilrU9-ZLHTgwpg

These came towards the end and they were all pretty standard, pretty good, nothing great. Really good macarons, however.

CHOCOLATE 3 WAYS

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m%C3%A9lisse-santa-monica-3#q49gFQeESfg3gJg1qq5d4g

The wife ate most if not all of this because...yknow..she's a girl. Girls like chocolate...I have just recently come to realize...I had a taste...it was aight.

DRY AGED STEAK N BEEF CHEEK

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m%C3%A9lisse-santa-monica-3#c9WcWXnrjJ8nFQgIBCHmKw

Dry Aged New York Steak, Braised Beef Cheek, Swiss Chard, Nantes Carrot, Sauce au Poivre. This was EXCELLENT. Rich, meaty, peppery deliciousness.

BERRY DESSERT

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m%C3%A9lisse-santa-monica-3#KwVfxBGfk5XHOGQ7In8iKw

Ohhhh, pretty...and delicious. My favorite dessert of the night. What? I like my desserts just like the wife likes her men....

fruity as fu*k."
"My favorite french restaurant in Los Angeles (for that matter my favorite restaurant in LA). I rate it above L'Orangerie, Le Petit ... (the place on little santa monica) or the one in Bel Air.

I love their food & wine-parings, ambiance and service. Last time I was there I had the Cart-Blanche menu and loved it."
"Took my boyfriend here. We had the non-alcoholic pairing with our service. I think quite a bit of the dishes were too acidic. We also had a rare venison with a coffee rub as one of the last proteins along with chicken. We left hungry as their menu was very small portions and does not account for people not liking some of the proteins. We popped over to Citrin afterwards for dinner which was a better experience.

Josiah Citrin was present during our service but he didn't bother saying at least a sentence to the room. The room we stayed in was very small and poorly ventilated. As people got more drunk towards the end of service it was very hot and overall uncomfortable in the tiny closet like room. I was also disappointed we did not learn about the ingredients, the sourcing the overall experience from farm to table."
"It's just five star dining plain and simple. This is textbook fine dinging-yet still amazingly approachable and not overly stuffy.
It could be. Melisse has the right to be-well uptight, pretentious, cold. But it's not. Don't let me mislead you. This is very upscale, pampered, at times excessive eating. The difference is it still feels, well human.
I have been twice and from both experiences I can say order what ever you like. There is so much passion and attention to detail in every facet of their food you simply cannot go wrong. The only time you can go wrong is when you second guess yourself or tame your experience down.
Also you have to put implicit trust in the sommelier Brian. The man is genius with wine. And although that statement may seem like an over exaggeration, it's not. He is gifted with a palate of the Gods.
Order the truffle egg. Don't look at the price. Don't try and justify it. Just go there and order it.
Always go with a tasting menu.
Share. Share. Share.

Oh- And consume as much of that bacon focaccia as you can without spoiling your appetite.
:)"
"This place is overrated and overpriced. I took my husband here to celebrate his birthday and the whole time we were just making fun of the whole experience. We just couldn't believe this was the great Melisse.

The inside of the restaurant is completely outdated. Ugly colors, no windows, and decor was random.

Since it was a special occasion, we chose to do the 10 course meal. On the menu, all the dishes sounded like they were going to be amazing. But nothing really stood out to us.

Our experience with our waiter was a bit awkward. The way they would describe the dishes was a bit pretentious and also they sounded bored at the same time.

What's even worse was the dessert they gave us because it was his birthday. I love macarons and my husband loves caneles so at first we were pleasantly surprised. But the caneles were hard as bricks and the macarons tasteless and the texture was gummy. The jelly and chocolates were not memorable.

The meal cost us about $400 (since we didn't do the wine pairing) and on top of that they charge me an extra 3% upcharge to help subsidize their employees' health insurance! Ok you need to stop being so cheap with your employees that you expect your customers to pay for them!

I'll give them that some of the dishes are beautifully prepared, but that's the only thing good about this place."
Delicious! Best birthday and special occasion dinner restaurant. The chef is delightful and very accommodating. The chef will make you a custom menu to your diet if you call ahead (gluten free - no dairy - no fish). With all those concerns you would think the menu would be limited - nope. Best meal I've ever had.
Probably the best meal I've ever had in my life. I would eat here every week if I could. It's also one of the most expensive meals I've ever had but totally worth it. The C√¥te de boeuf was unbelievable. You have to order it right away due to the length of time for preparation. This is ultimate dining experience.
"This was one of the best meals I have ever had only made better by the service. Request Ryan. Not only is he amazing and kind and he has the best recommendations. I would definitely recommend getting The Ten and having a taste of everything. You will be beyond stuffed.

Thanks for the first-class treatment!!!!!!!"
"unbelievable!!! unbelievable service and food and experience. truly spectacular. and at 600bucks for 2, it should be! it was romantic and a most memorable evening all the way around. one of my top 5 dining experiences ever... but i also was enamoured with my dinner companion : ) it was a wonderful thing to share."
"We went for the DineLA tasting menu. The setup was VERY impressive: heaters all over the place, distanced tables, menu online, all personnel wearing masks. The menu was lovely. Started with an oyster amuse bouche- very tasty, even though oysters are not my thing. Two kinds of bread, basil and French roll. We could have filled up on those, for sure. Then, the Hamachi, followed by an incredible Lobster Bolognese, and the beef as my main course. The beef was cooked to perfection, 3 different cuts. My husband had the duck and he enjoyed that as well, cooked perfectly. The chocolate dessert was a delicious ending. We didn't have wine, but we did have killer cocktails!! The service was impeccable and even with masks on, the servers were very friendly. Congratulations to the staff for making us feel comfortable and warm!!"
"I have been to Melisse several times over the years and what can I say.... 6 course Chef Josiah Citrin tasting menu. That's 2 appetizers, 2 first courses and 2 entrees. Perfect atmosphere, classical and modern French recipes.

This is not a hyped restaurant since they been around for many years..I beleive the first time I went there was around Dec, 1999. Melisse is more about food, excellent Serveur de restaurant service and great French cuisine has characterized by its extreme diversity and style.

One of my Best ""HELLO"" to Chef Josiah Citrin @ Melisse. Thank you."
"After 6 years of living in LA, my husband & I finally made our way to Melisse. We're not big fans of fancy dining but every once in a while, it's nice to dress up and go eat some fancy food (IMO). Service was really great, attentive, and not stuffy or stuck up. The sommelier used the word ""gnarly"" to describe a red wine - which is awesome. I also thought I heard a server mutter ""so good"" as he was placing my Lobster Bolognese on the table. We did the regular tasting menu (not the 10) and added the Rotisserie Chicken (which was damn good and moist).
The Wild Sea Bream and Spot Prawns were both good for the first course. By the time we got to the entree, I was already full but I still ate all of my Prime Beef Rib Eye Cap (which was tasty but heavy).

When presented with the choices of bread, get the basil brioche. So good.

We circled the block for parking but it's largely permit only and meters. Just valet and save yourself the time.

I don't know why people think the ambience is dated - it looked good to me. There are a lot of Asians but Asians love to eat good food."
"As an all-around fine dining experience in LA, Melisse really takes the cake. Although I haven't eaten at as many fancy restaurants as I'd like to in the area, I got the full experience at Melisse and it couldn't have been any better.

I went to Melisse a couple months ago with a party of four. We all ordered the Chef's Carte Blanche and a few small complimentary dishes were thrown in before the course because my brother goes there all the time, or maybe because this is just that kind of place.

Every single course left me very impressed, and a couple even blew my mind. With only a few bites to get the idea, take your time and don't just devour a course in anticipation of something better. When you take that second or third taste and realize what was intended with each dish, that's when you know Melisse really kicks ass.

Aside from the Carte Blanche, there was a wine pairing and a fromage course, both of which deserve mention. The service was fabulous, with everything executed flawlessly and our server knowing each dish inside & out. I was particularly impressed with her knowledge of the cheeses. There were numerous varieties and she seemed to have unique insight on the flavor of each one, making good recommendations. The bus boys and the host were very professional as well. My brother told me he had come out of Melisse to find that the valet had gotten his car washed for him.

For the Carte Blanche for four, the wine pairing, and fromage, the bill ended up around $980, with a service charge but not including tip. Visit Melisse in moderation and its worth every penny."
"The foie gras course dinner was very well done. Maybe not as refined in precise culinary technique as that done by Tony Esnault at Patina, but still very good nonetheless. The food rating on this particular dinner is a 4 plus. However, I found that the service in this highly rated restaurant to be lacking. For example:

1) At the beginning of dinner, I asked for a wine pairing to start with my amuse gueule and the foie gras cromesquis, but I didn't get the wine pairing until I was served the foie gras flan which was course #3 so I had to refrain from eating courses #1-2 until the wine arrived.

2) The Torchon course took so very long for it to be served that we had to inquire as to its ETA. This may seem rather picky, but when you pay $360 per person, tax and tip included, you expect better performance.

3) The ""bus boys"" when they came to serve us water would come right between us when we were speaking and interrupted the flow of conversation. They could have approached our table behind either of us in order to serve us so that we would not be disturbed. A haute cuisine dining establishment should train its help to be as unobtrusive and efficient as possible.

4) I've been to many fine dining restaurants, and all the successful ones seem to have the goal of making sure their guests are comfortable, catered to, and trying to ensure that their restaurant experience is nonpareil. I didn't get that impression at Melisse. I got the impression that the higher echelon waiters feel that they are the ""chosen ones"" and somehow ""subconsciously"" feel that they can be condescending.

On the surface, this is not so obvious, but the body language, tone of voice, facial expressions did not match with the more neutral vocalizations when they interacted with us. I have had far better restaurant staff experience in terms of their warmth, welcome, eagerness to ensure customer satisfaction in places like Patina, Gary Danko, Valentino, Fig, Rivera, Petrossian, SAAM, Brandywine, etc.

With all these service oriented faux pas in a highly rated and expensive restaurant, I feel that I must give this a 2 star rating although the food was 4 plus. Salomon, you were the only one who rated a ""Gary Danko"" level of service (warm, friendly, caring, intuitive, engaged, enthusiastic) at Melisse. Thanks for being the one person who was truly pleasant there."
"Hmmm what can I say ? Expensive?-yes! Fine dining?-yes! Best food experience?-yes! Was the food tasty?-yes! Was the service excellent?-yes! so why only 4stars? You guessed it.. It was way too expensive! But was it worth it?-yes!
Will not go back. Why not? This kind of restaurants most people will probably just go once. But I'm sure they got their regulars..There are so many good restaurants with great chefs to try yet so will just do 1 at a time I guess.
The 10 course meal. Stay away from the truffle, I think it's a rip off and overrated!
Do it once at least.. Yolo!"
"Came here for the foie gras fundraiser event. Wow. Place is fancy for sure. It's not like BOA where there a lot people dressed somewhat casual cool - definitely wear a collared shirt or a blazer if you're a guy.

So I don't remember the names of the stuff I had, it was all foie of course, but my faves where the foie ice cream and the foie w/ lobster. The presentation of the food was great, using sauces to dress up the food. I actually wanted to lick my plate clean but the girl I was with woulda probably thought I was disgusting and the patrons there would have looked down on me. Plus I want to go back, so I didn't want to make a fool of myself haha.

One of the best meals of my life. Wines were great- they served a TON of alcohol for the wine pairings.

I would definitely go back there- even if there is no foie gras."
"Love Love Love the food here. Many chowhounders attempt to draw the comparison between Melisse and Providence but you just can't...

I treated my brother here for his 19th birthday, and they decorated the table with a happy birthday plaque and some cookies to take home! Food was delicious, authentic, and of course, French. My Absolute favorite dish was the egg caviar, first few bites where you can get the perfect proportion are heavenly.

Similar to Providence, they constantly bring you a variety of fresh rolls (loved the basil roll) to ensure that you will be full at the end of your meal. Portions are smaller than Providence but like I said, it's a different cuisine altogether so you must try both!

-1 star for the service, which was not well coordinated. Waiters seemed to be a bit staggered in serving the dishes and at some point one of our servers took a smoking break and came back smelling like smoke.

-1 star for the ambiance, I like the relaxed/non snobby atmosphere (providence was a bit snobby) but the crowd became loud and somewhat rowdy as the night went on. It kind of killed the appreciation of such amazing fine food. I need relative silence to really taste what I'm eating. (Yes, my sense of hearing impairs my taste).

Also, no mixologists, just an open bar but I hear concoctions are currently in development."
"forgive me yelpers, for i have sinned.

i was so excited about the food at melisse that i forgot to take good notes for my review and couldn't be bothered to figure out the right settings on my new camera. as such, the descriptions, like the pics, are a bit fuzzy. i promise to go back again soon and update both!

if you stalk the simonster as you should, you'd know that my ""last meal"" in my profile has always been ""many courses of french with carefully paired wines."" so you can appreciate how excited i was to take my friend there for her birthday.

beautifully remodeled, melisse oozes modern, sophisticated elegance. it gave me fond memories of my dearly departed old fave l'orangerie. the staff is incredibly competent, if a bit rigid, despite my repeated attempts to get someone to crack a conspiratorial grin.

we both elected to get the tasting menu, which is four courses for $105. we also got one wine pairing to share which was around $100, and a couple additional glasses for around $20 each. note that the pairings were pretty light pours. melisse offers a ""carte blanche"" tasting menu for $210 that is 13 courses. next time i might order that to share because everything is so tasty i want to try it all!

the chef started us out with a few complementary courses:

- a sliced grape coated in goat cheese and pistachios: cute, dainty little amuse with great harmony between the sweetness of the grape and the earthiness of the cheese and nuts.
- a shot glass of something savory at the bottom and creme fraiche on top: dangit, this is where we forgot to take notes. you use a little spoon to dip down through all of the layers. tasty, but i can't remember what the flavors were.
- a cube of smoked salmon with a wonton skin crisp on top - again a nice little amuse. super savory.

thankfully i can cheat off of the menu for the tasting courses.

first course:
- chestnut soup, celery-hash, truffle mousse: awesome, subtle, smooth, cut nicely by the celery.
- maine diver scallops, arugula, endives, fumet d'oursin: so savory, with sweetness from the uni foam and bits of uni on top. the endives give it just the right degree of acidity.

second course:
- maine lobster ""thermidor,"" creamy spinach, lobster-mustard sabayon: one of my favourite courses. chunks of lobster on the half shell with a gorgeous sauce topped with melted cheese. amazing.
- fish of the day: this was a beautiful piece of poached alaskan halibut with an amazing bechamel sauce and roasted capers, paired with a puree of sweet peas and the most amazingly earthy and savory mushrooms. each ingredient was great separately, but combined, incredible.

entree course:
- prime rib eye and beef cheek ravioli, heirloom carrots, wilted winter greens, bordelaise sauce: this sounded so good, we both ordered it. the prime rib was perfectly cooked and tender, nicely complemented by the bordelaise sauce. the beef cheek ravioli was reminiscent of the smaller one at XIV. incredibly tasty at both places, although beef cheek must be tough to cook because it was also slightly overdone at both.

dessert course:
- sticky toffee pudding, mocha malt ice cream, red berry-hibiscus consomme: with all due respect to being innovative, i've gotta say i'm not a big fan of the trend by many restaurants to mix savory flavors into desserts. thankfully melisse bucks this trend and both desserts were sweet, tasty goodness. the sticky toffee pudding satisfies your craving for rich decadence.
- passion fruit parfait, coconut sorbet, pistachios and lemongrass: light, sweet, delightful.

the chef finished us off with a couple additional dessert courses on little boats:
- the first boat was eaten so fast, we literally can't remember what it was. sorrrrry! i can't even remember what TYPE of dessert it was, it was so good.
- the second boat had an assortment of macaroons and mini cookies. nice, but unfortunately a bit boring after everything else we'd experienced.

overall, my favorite french and one of my top 5 restaurants, in LA. evidently i'm not alone in thinking this, because justin timberlake and jessica biel sat next to us!!!

forgive me for writing that last bit too... =/"
"DineLA has officially launched the higher priced menu at $95+ a person. Went to Melisse last night and had a wonderful experience again! At $265 for two people (with tax, tip, valet, and $9 water for the table - if you want free water you have to say regular water if you say flat you get the $9 water), it's a great deal! I think one day I will do the full course tasting menu, but for now, DineLA hits the spot. For the first time, I did not sit in the main dining room and I gotta say, I LOVED the private room with only 4 tables. I will sit there from now on. We sat at the table where the curtain was right on my back, which I actually liked. :) Darker, more intimate, quieter, felt like you were at someone's home sorta, with butlers. I forget what the amuse bouche was, it was sorta like a molecular gastronomy fake grape (like the fake olives) and it came with a half grape with some white chocolate and nuts on it. For the first course, it was the Stella Bay Oyster. OMG - so good. It was so light, refreshing, and tasted PERFECT. I wanted another one. Just enough salt/briney-ness with the smattering of green onion made it sing! The second option was the Savoy Cabbage Potage or the Santa Barbara Ridgeback Prawns. My boyfriend got the potage, I got the prawns. While the prawns were good GET THE POTAGE. It's so rich, decadent, creamy, filling, and it warms your soul! I was sad I did not get the potage. They gave you a few prawns, so that was nice to have so many, but trust me, you want the potage. My boyfriend was using the bread to wipe down the bowl to get the last bits of the soup; I kid you not. No shame in our dining game! The bread also came around this time and out of I think 6 or 7 options, we got 3 each. I really wanted to try all of them, but don't want to be rude about it. I got the green basil one, the bacon foccacia, and the olive bread. Next time I should get 3 basil ones. LOL The butter here is DIVINE, I tell ya!!!!! I always taste a speck of butter without any bread just to get a true taste of it and DAMN! The butter here is so flavorful it's like eating a creamy CHEESE. I could seriously just eat the butter alone like it was candy. Yes, IT WAS THAT GOOD. Then came the Caramelized Chatham Bay Cod - the caramelized element was really good. For our entrees, I got the Flat Iron Steak, boyfriend got the Sonoma Lamb Loin. He loved it, I don't eat lamb, so I didn't try it. The steak was so tender, so melt-in-your-mouth it was like eating butter! I liked the steak more than the beef cheek. I really enjoyed the diced mushrooms and the potato gratin was good. We also got compliments from the chef, a mashed potato dish, so did the table next to us. Not sure why... maybe our entree came out a little late or maybe they can see I've returned? Anyway, the mashed potatoes were also to die for - the texture was so smooth like pudding, the creaminess, the flavors, very happy to have received it complimentary! Last course was dessert - loved the ice cream, roasted hazelnuts and the entire dish - sweet, but not too sweet. Then comes out the other desserts - 4 pieces. I do like the white grape jelly square and I'm not a big fan of macarons, but here I liked it. Another item was like a churro cake and also a half sphere of chocolate. Everything here is delicious, some more than others, but soooo worth the 5 stars as every dish is made with such detail, passion, and thought. Whatever you eat here will most likely be the best version of it that you have ever eaten, failing that, the most inventive version of that dish. Valet is $8.50, street parking is also possible if you look. Don't forget to eat at Charcoal Venice, Chef Josiah's new restaurant. Another restaurant on par with Melisse is Providence. I've been to Valentino was not a fan. I gave Spago 4 stars.

"Amazing restaurant. We enjoyed every course that came out. I've had a lot of Michelins... French laundry... Providence... Manresa... Some meet expectations and many don't. I'd say melisse is on par with French laundry but that's me.

If you were hesitating on trying this I wouldn't because it def met my expectations"
"Everything on the tasting menu here is perfect. The taste, the portions and the presentation. We came here for an anniversary dinner and they spoiled us with little extras. The service is what you should get at a fine restaurant. You must try the tasting menu here and don't skip out on the good wine they offer here."

"Melisse has to be the finest restaurant in Los Angeles.

Its expensive but you really get a first class meal there on every level. The service is pretty phenomenal and the food is as good as it gets. If you do not have a budget and are looking for a special occasion dinner, Melisse has to be on the top of that list."
"Totally worth the hype...and the price. The service is impeccable and the food lives up to the reputation. The waiters are beyond helpful with the menu and wine.

If you enjoy making dinner your activity for the whole night this is the place. Perfect pace to the 10 menu. We had a 7:30 reservation and left around 11."
Really good French dining!! The service was very attentive without being overbearing. The food was one of the best French cuisine that I had. The foie GRAS and the truffle risotto were really good. The price was decent especially when you compared with other fine restaurants Really pleased with the whole experience!!
"2 Michelin stars? Not to me.

First off, the menu is confusing.

For that amount of money, we were not impressed. Tasting menu was OK but main course (beef) was boring & bland. There was some horrible meat stuffed tomato that was disgusting. The John Dory had no flavor.

The onion soup was amazing as was the cheese & chocolate dessert. Not worth what we paid though. And the atmosphere is pretty stuffy - standard for fancy French, perhaps but that doesn't make it any more acceptable.

Overall, a disappointment after all I'd read about it. Maybe Lucques is truly better?"
"For our farewell LA dinner, my boyfriend and I looked for a restaurant that would leave a lasting impression on our dining experiences, so we had to go out with a bang! It definitely had to be a special pick, and with the help of yelp reviews (thank you!) we found our gem: Melisse.

Think of your dreamiest dinner: hosts treating you like a [well-liked] celebrity, waiters serving you with utmost attention, staff members harmoniously working together like a well-oiled machine, comfortable seating, a place for my PURSE to rest, classy but laid back ambiance, and food so delicious your eyes roll to the back of your head. Yes, this describes my gastronomical experience at Melisse. All that was missing was the dream tune, clouds, and lights shining down from Heaven.

The only things I would change are:

1. to expand my belly a tad more so I wouldn't be too full at the end of the 10 course meal (and then proceed to eat more of the treats they give you!)

and

2. receive fatty paychecks so I can fly to LA and eat here more often!!

You, Melisse, are my favorite restaurant EVER."
"What an extravagant treat at the Melisse for my 100th Yelp review. I regard my experience here as the epitome of French find dining. First off, I love the purple/white color themed decor. For our anniversary celebration, they prepared us a couple of small surprises. The service is impeccable. As for dinner, we went with the 10-course tasting menu. Each course came with exquisite presentation. But that's something you'd expect from a restaurant of this caliber. As far as flavor profiles go, every course ranging from the amuse-bouche to the dessert tasted good but lacked that 'WOW' factor. The highlight of the night for me goes to the Egg Caviar- definitely a dish that stood out among the others. In my opinion, Melisse is good for the neighborhood super-rich and celebrity sighting. I think there are plenty of fine-dining options in Los Angles where you get exceptional tasting food and service that are worth the high price tag. I'm sad to say that Melisse is not. I'd say skip if it's on your restaurant bucket list unless you're super bored with a lot of dough to shell out."
"Top knock, fancy French affair. If you're looking for something special hit this place up. From scallops with caviar to beef tongue everything was delicious! I would stick to the wine list my cocktail was just okay. One may tend to think you will leave a restaurant like this hungry but that certainly was not the case!"
"My wife and I went here for her birthday. We were expecting a great experience but the food, ambience and service exceeded even our expectations. We spent the night comparing this dining to when we went to Bouchon in Napa and Grand Cascade in Paris. It compared very well.

The meal was pricey but expected. I will not go over all of what we had as others have done that. What I will say is the layers upon layers of flavor and tastes was truly wonderful and leaving you to wonder why others can't do what they are doing.

We left contemplating when we will come back! Bravo!"
"This review is late (I went in February), but the experience on my taste buds is still just as vivid. It was my first time there so we went all out and ordered the 10 year anniversary tasting menu with wine pairings (10 dishes) and it was absolutely amazing, although we practically had to be rolled out in a wheelbarrow because we were so stuffed.

Every dish was spectacular, maybe that is because they are the top dishes from the past 10 years.

The waiter and servers were very attentive (yes that is plural) my husband and I had personal servers presenting each masterpiece of a dish.

My personal favorite was the Lobster Bolognese, although it was just a tease. Can't wait to try a full serving.

To top it off, we were given a fancy box of chocolate truffles since the waiter overheard that we were celebrating my birthday."
"We came back to celebrate our 4th anniversary and my graduation this past weekend. I must say, they never disappoint.

This was a completely different menu from our initial visit. In this menu/offering, every dish was just as gorgeous in both presentation and flavor in addition to being wildly creative and sooo delicious.

I really did not have a bad bite. Highlight for me was the halibut. I've had numerous halibut dishes elsewhere in various preparations but THIS has to be my favorite of all time. The layer of seaweed gel√©e was really cool and all of the elements within that dish worked so beautifully together. And can we talk about the texture? So smooth and silky - YUM!

My fiance, in contrast, is a red meat lover so the lamb loin was his favorite. To be honest, I was quite full at this point but that was also an incredible dish. The meat was so soft and tender that was accompanied by 3 different sauces that paired well.

Thank you again to the chefs for an epic menu and the staff for their amazing service. We had a great time celebrating and will be back again soon."
"Among the best 2-3 restaurants in the city. Always outstanding food. Service is usually great although we have had some misses (nobody was in charge of our table then everybody was). Regardless, the reason I go to eat is food and while the ambiance is fine, the food is supreme. Not to be missed if you like to eat well."
"I took my parents here for their 30th anniversary, and didn't regret the choice. They welcomed us to the restaurant with a ""happy anniversary"" and presented a gift to my parents. Then they seated us at a great corner table which had just the right amount of privacy. The waiter and sommelier were both very patient with us as we quizzed them about the tasting menu and the wine choices. And then they knew to leave us alone to enjoy (but were always attuned to our need for service).

Pricey of course, but for a (very) special occasion I don't think you could do much better."
My husband surprised me for our 5 year wedding anniversary and booked dinner for us at Melisse. We had the 10 course tasting menu and we were not disappointed! The somolier came over and assisted us with wine pairing for our meal which was extremely elegant and exciting. I have a gluten allergy and the chef was able to accommodate my needs while still maintaining the amazing integrity of everything he brought to us. Overall our experience was outstanding and I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to have an amazingly special and memorable dinner.
"Came here in 2010 with my then gf. Ordered the 8 course tasting. Somewhere between course 1 and 2 we started arguing about something couples typically fight about. Then came the lobster bolognese. The immediate silence was evidence of how good it was. Unfortunately, the fighting continued where it left off and we broke up between courses 3 and 4. Too upset to enjoy the rest of the meal, we jumped up hoping to be the first to storm out in dramatic fashion and leave the other to face the pity of onlookers. But before either of us could make our move, out came course 5 - foie gras three ways. We sat in silence for the remainder of the tasting, an unspoken understanding that we were in the middle of an incredible meal.
After I paid the bill we went our separate ways and never saw each other again. A sad but delicious memory."
"I am so full! And so exhausted...for small portions this stuff really fills you up. Our meal took about 2.5 hours total and it felt like food was constantly coming out. One dish after another. But I'm not complaining, the food was straight up gourmet. The kind that melts in your mouth and leaves you completely satisfied. Heyo!

The bread that came out is freshly made at the restaurant everyday and consists of options like bacon bread, olive bread, brioche, basil brioche (super good).

They also have a little bench for your purse to class it up even more. And the service is really professional.

The only thing that didn't measure up to that type of standard is the bathroom. It wasn't clean enough and the washcloths were not of the best quality. They could have been softer. But who goes to restaurants for their lavatories?"
"Our experience here was OK, but OK isn't good enough for a 10-course meal for which the bill with tip (no alcohol) is $656. The food was very good, sometimes but not always great. The service was indifferent. After we ordered, our waiter hardly spoke to us until the final course, when suddenly he became friendly and attentive (almost time to calculate that tip, after all!). Sous chefs came out to explain each course--nice touch--which were served by bus staff, as our waiter served courses to the other tables around us and socialized loudly with them. Why did our waiter basically ignore us? Because we didn't order cocktails and wine, a fact that likely reduces our bill 35% - 40%. It evidently wasn't worth it to him to attend to our needs. There would be absolutely no reason for us to pay a return visit to this restaurant."
"How fitting it is that my 300th review is for Melisse! My hubby took me here for my birthday (number will remain a secret haha) and it was a wonderful experience

When you got to Melisse, you are not just here for a meal but rather the whole dining experience as a whole. Melisse is a two Michelin star restaurant serving French cuisine. Valet parking or street parking available. We opted for Valet ($8).

The entrance of the restaurant is a bit hidden but once you step inside, a simple elegant set up for their dining area. We opted for the 10 course tasting meal ($175/per person OUCH) and probably ended up getting two extra appetizer (mussels and grapes) and an extra dessert plate for a total of 13 courses that evening (YAY).

These are like tapas (small plates) and really give you just enough to crave more! My favorite included the egg caviar, the truffle butternut squash soup, the fois gras (which I never had!), and the king crab. I was not a fan of the liberty duck and the prime beef ribeye. Perhaps, it was too heavy of a course to set at the end as I was getting really full off all the other dishes! At first, you think you wouldn't be full but then we ended up surprisingly stuffed!

Some other notable things: if you leave the table, they will come by to fold your table napkin and neatly put in back on the table for you, if you are a lady, someone is always there to pull out your seat, if you are coming for your birthday, everyone who works there and sees you will wish you a happy birthday as you take your seat, if you want bread, just stick to the green pesto basil bread."
"I was taken here for my birthday, and I very much enjoyed our delicious (and long!) dinner. The main area's elegant interior and the impeccable service alone validated the earning of its two Michelin stars.

Upon first walking in though, we were guided to the back room for a more ""private dining experience."" This private dining area had about three tables max and little to no interior decor. It really wasn't much to look at. I politely asked to be moved to the main area upon walking in, and we were taken care of immediately by our attentive server. I guess some people prefer a VERY private dining experience, but you might as well just eat at home. I believe the atmosphere and the decor of fine dining is as important as the food itself and was surprised that anyone would want to eat in such a closed room.

We opted for the main 10 course meal, priced at $150/person, plus $50 supplement for Truffle Risotto. Our server told us they had just changed the menu for the summer, so this may be a little different from the traditional menu:

1. Amuse
2. Egg Caviar: Lemon Cr√®me Fra√Æche, American Caviar
3. Wild Japanese Kanpachi: Champagne Cured Salmon Roe, Tokyo Negi, Turnip-Brul√©e
4. Dandelion Velout√©: Oregon Chanterelles, Crispy Buratta
5. Seared Foie Gras: Persimmon, Pain d'Epice, Santa Barbara Pistachios
6. Maine Lobster: Matsutake Mushrooms, Salsify, Lobster Broth
I got:
6. White Truffle Sweet Corn Agnolotti
7. Black Bass ""En Ecailles"": Black Trumpet Mushrooms, Chestnuts, Kyoho-Amaranth Broth
8. Prime Beef Rib Eye Cap & Braised Wagyu Beef Cheek: Potato Galette, Swiss Chard, Carrot, Bordelaise Jus
9. Pont L'Ev√™que Tart: Petite Salad, Honey Pepper Gastrique
10. White Chocolate & Macadamia: Mochaccino, Macadamia Crumble, Milk Chocolate Sorbet

Everything was gorgeous to look at and my palettes were well entertained. But please portion control. I was so full by the fifth dish that I started to get annoyed of my unreliable stomach that let me down. I don't remember much on the later half of the course, but overall, I loved it here. It's somewhat similar to Eleven Madison Park in NY."
"An unbelievable dinning experience worth every penny. Every morsel of food melts in the mouth and gushes with flavor unfamiliar to many palates. The staff, ambience, and orchestrated presentation complete the meal and demonstrate why M√©lisse has won so many awards and been recognized amongst the very best in the world."
"Chef Citrin is amazing! He even takes the time away from his kitchen to greet his customers in the dining room. The food is exquisite and artistic, the service is excellent and the whole dining experience was a real birthday treat! We had the 10 course meal and found each tasting dish completely different and delicious!"
"Two Michelin stars french cuisine with some Asian influence. There menu changes but food is always amazing. Probably one of the best fine dining Los Angeles has to offer. There are only 14 seats and the entrance is a hidden door on Wilshire. But if you are trying to impress someone, this would be the place to take them."
"Just a fantastic dining experience. Rarely do I have the opportunity to have a five course meal with each dish a memorable experience. Ironically there was a seasonal vegetable salad that I tried which I enjoyed far more than the filet mignon main course. Now, it is impossible to come here without taking the prices into account and I have to admit that this meal was a business dinner so I paid for nothing! In this regard, if I did have to pay for the meal then I'd imagine I would be more critical. This is definitely a destination location wherever you live in greater LA."
"I really wanted to like this place. I've been waiting a long time and I even brought out my bottle of 2006 Opus One. We had the 10 course tasting menu and substituted one of them with the truffle risotto (not worth $50).

I think my favorite dish of the night was the Amuse bouche, raw oyster with lemon jelly and creme fraiche. All the other dishes were presented well but did not taste good. All of them where not flavored well and just lacked the quality that you would expect from a michelin star restaurant.

I am giving this place one star because I completely regret coming here. It is extremely over priced for what it is and I think their michelin star should be revoked. Im not exactly sure why people think this place is so good it did not cut it for me at all. If you want a better way spend your money, go to Providence!"
"Service was great, food was good but nothing to really write home about.

We got the 7 course tasting for dinner tonight. At the end of the night we got 11 dishes served to us. The whole dinning experience was very nice. They constantly came by to refill our water, checking up on us to make sure everything is fine. We were there eating non stop for 3 hours straight. I got full before the entr√©e was even served. I wish I had gotten the 4 course instead. The portions might seem small but please don't let that fool you. They also had a 10 course menu, I don't know how people can possibly finish that if they weren't professional eating competitors.

I chose the 21 day aged duck for entr√©e but it had a tendon throughout and I couldn't cut through it no matter how hard I tried, my husband was even helping me cut them but the knife was either too dull or the tendon was too tough. I ended up cutting around it making a mess at the end. The taste of it was pretty good. But I have had better elsewhere. Other than that everything else were pretty good. Though for the price it is very steep. Again you're paying mostly for the fine dine experience instead of the food.

Little side note, they have Valet parking for $8.5 right next to the restaurant which is a plus. Not sure if it's owned by the restaurant or not. But tonight's experience at the valet was below average. We gave the valet guy $10 and were to tip when he pull up our car. He just took our $10 didn't bother to mention anything about change. I know it might sound crazy to some of you people that we just spent hundreds at the restaurant and still wonder about that $1.50 change. To me, it's more about principle. Plus he didn't even say a word. Not one single word came out of his mouth. No hi no thanks no bye so guess what I didn't even bother to tip because he didn't deserve any."
"This was, hands-down, the absolute best culinary experience I have ever had. CC & I went here in August for a very special occasion - it has to be VERY special for the price, but it was so worth it!

We chose to get the tasting menu, which I highly recommend. We were planning to add a cheese course, but by the time we got there we were so full we had to cancel it. They start off the meal with two amuse bouche. The sommelier was amazing - he posed a series of questions, then announced he had the perfect wine for us - and it was!

For the first course, I chose the lobster bolognese, based on the many terrific reviews on this site. CC chose their onion soup with crab cake. Wow! The first bites were heaven. Of the two, I preferred the crab cake and onion soup, but both were great. The lobster bolognese was amazingly complex, with flavors that complemented each other perfectly. I'm just an absolute sucker for crab cakes, I can't help it.

For the second course, I had the daily seafood, and CC had the black bass. So nice and light! It was a perfect second course. Then on to the main course - YUM!

I ordered the duck, which was a duck breast and confit. SO rich and succulent and melt-in-your-mouth amazing. CC had the lamb. I had a little bite of his, but by this point I was getting full, so I only had a taste. He was thrilled with it (lamb is his favorite).

We had ordered a cheese course, but by the time we'd been through the first 3, I wasn't sure how I could handle it. Luckily, the amazing wait staff must have noticed we were slowing down, because they checked in with us and we called off the cheese.

We finished with dessert, of course. I had the chocolate-chocolate-chocolate. I don't remember what CC ordered - it wasn't nearly on par with my dessert. They brought it out, and there was a ramekin of chocolate souffle, and a syringe filled with hot chocolate. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to just stick it in my mouth or what, but the waiter plunged it into the chocolate souffle to make a hot melted chocolate center. Next to that was a white chocolate covered ice cream ball. There was also a peanut butter crunch chocolate cake piece. Decadent, and well worth the calories.

I cannot recommend this restaurant more highly - this is the #1 place I would go for another major special occasion. Bring the wallet though - this ain't cheap!!"
The pinnacle of fine dining - don't let anyone tell you otherwise!
Crappy restaurant. I told the waiter and two other servers of my food allergies yet they still served it. Spent 4 hours in ER and nothing was even comped. Cheap! This place needs to lose its star. The food was over cooked and tastiest. Go to Providence if you truly want to have an experience of exceptional food and wine.
"I'm not sure why everyone is so impressed with this place. It's good but not great. Our waiter mentioned that ""Most people who eat here say wow!""

He's not wrong... I said wow several times:

Wow, the bread is not fresh.
Wow, they do the same molecular gastronomy and use the same glasses as SLS.
Wow, the portions are small.
Wow, this did not live up to my expectations.

Haha ok. So nothing was bad but nothing was out of this world either. The service was good.

You'll notice that it's mostly women that rated this place 5 stars and said it was amazing. That would be because they were more impressed with the price tag their dates had to pay than they actually were with the food.

Overall, it was $300 of ""meh"". I've had better. I guess two Michelin stars don't mean much. Why do people trust a tire company to rate food anyway?"
"the pre-vday dinner at melisse was ok. however, i wish my first foray to melisse was not on a set menu night as i'm sure the food would have been much better and not dumbed down for lovebirds.

that being said, the service was good with wine poured and water refilled in a timely manner. however, there was a mis-step when i was presented with the incorrect appetizer course. this was remedied gracefully and i was soon digging into some delicious foie gras.

the food:

- grape amuse: grape with goat cheese and a molecular grape gelee. decent.

- egg caviar poached egg, lemon-chive cr√®me fr√¢iche american osetra caviar: this dish was just ok and commanded a $20 up charge for a tiny dollop of caviar. i've had much better poached/coddled egg dishes.

- ""hot and cold foie gras"" artichoke, mandarin and lavender: this dish was excellent. the seared foie was on top of toasted brioche with a thin layer of mandarin. the foie terrine was also very good and you can taste the multiple layers of foie terrine with mandarin with a hint of lavender.

- maine lobster bolognese fresh capellini, truffle froth: this dish sounded spectacular but was lackluster. the pasta sauce was average but the lobster was cooked well. the truffle froth did not do much for me.

- seared hokkaido scallop asparagus, hazelnuts, yellow wine: the scallops were very good. keep in mind that hokkaido scallops are much smaller than the U10 variety we are usually served. despite the small size packs a nice sweet punch.

- filet of beef and braised cheek crushed potatoes, morel mushrooms, b√©arnaise, natural jus: this dish was decent. the filet was very tender but lacked a hearty beefy flavor. the braised cheek was good and also lacked a concentrated beefiness.

- truffle crusted sonoma lamb loin green garlic, ""cassoulet,"" jus d'agnue: this dish was very good. the truffle crust was awesome and the lamb was very tender. one the side was a small piece of lamb sausage which was also very good.

despite what sounds like a lot of food, i left melisse hungry....so much so that we went down the street and filled up on pizza at joes."
"Bonjour mes amies! I was treated to Thanksgiving dinner here by my adult daughter and her fianc√©e this year. I love French cuisine and used to be a taster for a French chef and we would go around to check out his competition. Oh la la! I learned a lot. So, it is that at Melisse we had the best table in the house---at least that is how it felt but probably every table feels the same. We had a cosy elevated booth at the back with a view of the dining room. A group of all male waiters dressed in black suits hovered around us --the bread tray waiter, the water boy, and the main waiter who felt obligated to explain the details of each dish when it was served....while we just wanted to dive in and eat it and enjoy the ambiance and each others company. The waiter with the tray of a variety of sliced (cold) breads (including brioche!) and using tongs put a a slice or two of your selection on your bread plate.
ALERT; NO GLUTEN FREE BREAD HERE. I'm sorry to say that the main course turkey seemed overly processed. There were three slices of white, and three slices of brown turkey, and my daughter's English fianc√©e thought the brown was duck (but duck it was not--thank goodness!). Underneath the identical turkey slices (turkey roll?) was a small mound of bland glutenous dressing. A few cranberries were scattered on top. (I will upload photos soon). We had the choice of two sides and I got the mashed potatoes and green beans that was very good. Oh---I had the scallops appetizer and it was amazing but two is just too few! (at least it was more than one!). For desert I had the double chocolate cake and it was so rich and sweet that I actually could not finish it. The cocktails were ($25 each) certainly made to perfection. There are no windows in the place and it was very dark inside. I don't know why they don't have windows or at least brighten up the place a bit. very dark. My daughter picked this place as she is an international executive with a global company and eats at Michelin star restaurants and had just eaten at a 3 Star Michelin restaurant in NYC and wanted to compare with this one that is supposed to be one of the rare MIchelin star rated restaurants in L.A.( 2 stars). Honestly, I am glad there were no prices on the prix fix menu as I didn't want to know the outlandish price they charged! We were seating #2 and there was a seating after us so it felt like we had a time limit so we did not linger for coffee after. There are lots of top level restaurants in L.A. that are more humbly priced, but also lots of wealthy diners to whom if you have to ask the price, you can't afford it. :-)"
"Best French Cuisine in LA.
Recommend the Carte Blanche Menu $140-ea"
This is not your neighborhood bistro. Get ready for elegant French.
"Generally, excellent food! Service is exceptional and a Sous chef comes out with every dish to explain what we're about to eat. Three courses to choose from. Their caviar egg plate was my favorite. Their corn soup---amazing!! Their rock fish was a little salty and their rabbit dish was a little tough. But overall, an A/A-"
"I love eating good food and the food hear is just okay! I guess I'm not into fine dinning because it wasn't really for my $$$$. I came here recently for dineLA and happy I didn't pay for the full tasting course because I would be upset with myself.

Nothing about our meal was impressive. Service was good that's all folks!"
"Main recommendation: Order the Dry Aged ""Cote de Boeuf Roti"". Looked awesome!

We did the 10 menu and it was a special treat. Be prepared for a looong evening due to ten courses. 3.5 hours in our case. But such a treat. Can't wait to return and enjoy the divine pleasures of culinary artistry that came out of that kitchen."
"WOW. My husband and I had a wonderful dinner experience! Celebrating our marriage, we decided to go for the ""10"" menu, which started with a palate cleansing citrus soda. The rest was spectacular! sweet pea soup, egg caviar, foie gras, scallops, lamb, steak, and desserts... amazingly delicious. Definitely a special dinner."
"When you want something special, this is the place. Creative preparation is a hallmark of Los Angeles dining. So many restaurants here, however, forget to build the flavor profiles necessary to support their presentation. This place is not one of them. It continues to astound with creative dish after dish. Large tasting menus are frequently offered that are a pure pleasure to eat and really demonstrate how creative they can be.

Each dish had me looking for superlatives. The creamy, mild burrata was paired with a bright, acidic tomato tarte. Wonderful.

Highly recommended!"
"If I had more days off and some extra money to blow, I would find a way to eat at Melisse once a month like I used to be able to (Oh, how I miss their lunch days!). I've had nothing but great meals there since day one, and I am always comforted when I see Josiah working the farmer's market on Wednesday morning. How many of those other guys do you actually see doing the work they claim they do?

I've never had a bad meal at Melisse. I've never sent anyone to Melisse who didn't thank me afterwards. I've never taken anyone who didn't enjoy their time there. I've been to all their other fine dining competitors in SoCal, and this is the best. Order the carte blanche, get a good bottle of Bordeaux, and remember what it's like to eat a meal that's executed like it should be both in the front of the house and the back of the house."
"4.5/5 Stars - 10 course tasting menu

As with many other reviewers who have had a dining experience with Providence, M√©lisse falls a little short compared to it.

Don't get me wrong, it isn't that I didn't enjoy it, but some of the items just fell short of expectation. By no means, was it not tasty though.

After much thought and discussion, my boyfriend and I have decided that the menu was really well thought out in terms of how delicate the dishes were. The amuse-bouches could've been better incorporated with the meal and I believe there were too many pur√©e of things.

The only thing that was SUPER disappointing was the fromage. Camembert with Truffles?...could've totally done better, and it was not tasty at all.

Desserts were amazing! In the end, they ended with a very refreshing dessert and chef's compliment totaling a good 13 courses. We could barely finish everything.

Overall, it was a great dining experience and the courses showcased the chef's creativeness in the use of his produces. I would however, return to Providence before I return to M√©lisse. Bon app√©tit!"
"I have a soft spot for this restaurant, it's where my BF took me to impress me on our first ""official"" date. Food was amazing! And that description doesn't do it justice. I love French food, and all dishes were done with perfection. It's a beautiful establishment as well. Service was impeccable. Definitely would recommend!"
"My meal and experience at this restaurant was one of the best I ever had. I ordered the tasting menu and what an adventure on the taste buds. One of the items was a foam textured appetiser that was in a shot glass. Man...that was crazy.

I would love to come back to this place sometime in the future for a special occasion."
"Went for a birthday dinner and they did not disappoint. They converted the parking lot to a lovely dining area with table spaced apart. All staff was masked and most wore gloves and face shields in addition. Their tasting menu offers options,but we chose the a la carte. The Melisse salad was very good and had a lot to offer. My husband had the prawns and enjoyed them. He also enjoyed the beef duo and raved about the sauce. I had the lobster bolognese which I had previously had as take away and it was so much better fresh. Service was very attentive. It was a lovely evening."
"Melisse is one of my favorite restaurants... my experiences here have been spectacular, to say the least, from beginning to end. The service was among the best I have ever experienced anywhere. Melisse's staff members are very personable and knowledgeable about the food. The first time my BF and I came here we ordered the 10 course tasting menu, which was $150 a head. Pricey? NO, because the food is exceptional! Every course is artfully crafted, you can really appreciate the chef's creativity and impeccable execution. This place is truly special and the food really speaks for it's self. I could go on and on-- bottom line: Melisse's tasting menus must be experienced to be appreciated.


***I recommend: Egg caviar, Sunchoke soup, Cote de Boeuf, Corn Velouette, Lobster Bolognese, and the Chocolate, Chocolate, Chocolate dessert."
"If I closed my eyes and traveled to food heaven I would be walking through a purple door and into M√©lisse. Oh where do I start with this restaurant?! It truly is a slice of heaven. From the ambiance that captures you from the moment you enter, to the soft light, and attentive staff, M√©lisse is certainly a standout in the Los Angeles area, a place saturated with its fair share of expensive and unique eateries. And while the restaurant itself captured a piece of my heart, it is the food and drinks that captured my soul and will ensure my return. Our server, Doug, was the perfect mix of attentive yet respectful of our time and space. He made perfect recommendations for both dishes and the wines we should pair with our meal, and ensured our satisfaction throughout the night. I am someone who loves food, but is less experienced in the art of pairing foods with appropriate wines. Doug's choices seemed to enhance the flavors of our meal and really took the enjoyment factor to another level. Thank you Doug, and M√©lisse for such a fabulous culinary experience. We will be back soon!"
"Sigh - really hate writing this updated review.

in a nutshell, Chef Ian (Melisse head Chef at the time) is not Chef Ken.

We had dinner at Melisse and kept expecting that ""WOW"" factor -- this didn't happen. The entrees may have been interesting in terms of preparation, but misses the mark in terms of taste. The tastes were ""just okay"".

We last ate at Melisse's new tasting room just before the Covid shutdown. At that time, Melisse was headed by Chef Ken. We fondly remember that eating experience, with most, if not all, the entrees having that ""WOW"" factor. We left with very happy taste buds and happy tummies that night.

Unfortunately, Melisse is now the province of newly hired Chef Ian. This time, our taste buds said ""eah"".

Next time, we plan to eat at Citrin, where Chef Ken oversees the food preparations.

Interestingly, I just happened to be speaking with my cousin. I mentioned to her our dissatisfaction with our recent experience at Melisse. Guess what: 2 of her close friends also just had dinner at Melisse's recently. Her friends, like us, previously loved Melisse. But, also like us, based on their latest recent experience, will not be going back due to their ""eah"" experience. Like us, her friends next time will instead make reservations at Citrin instead of Melisse.

As a side note, the sommelier, Mathew, is excellent."
"Eating the 10-course dinner at Melisse is similar to going on a three-hour, epic culinary journey. You almost feel like Frodo on his quest for the ring starting off with fun, light dishes, moving onto heavier fare in the middle, and ending on a sweet note with the cheese course and desserts.

The dinner started out in a playful way with a grape and jalapeno popper amuse bouche, followed by a homemade cactus soda. Then came the oyster appetizer, soft poached egg with caviar, and finally an abalone dish with squid ink as sauce. Later on we had soup, squid, another fish dish (maybe some sort of tuna), halibut, and lamb courses, as well as a cheese course and two dessert courses.

Pheeeew. Man--I almost get tired just trying to remember everything we ate!

There wasn't a bad bite in the entire menu. However, diners be warned that that most of the meal included seafood components. Out of the 12 courses we had, over half were of the fish variety, but the flavors were so good, I think they could change any fish-hater's mind.

The sommelier was one of my favorite, surprise additions to the meal. He was really funny and had some hilarious real-life comparisons for wine flavors (sex, dirt, and grit to name a few.)

The only snafu of the entire meal was that we were charged an extra bottle of wine on our bill. (We just accepted the high price that was on the bottom of the check and didn't even look over the rest of the bill to make sure it was correct.)

Luckily, a server caught the error before we left, but our credit cards had already been ran twice, causing some problems with our bank's fraud departments. (What Chase bank, you don't think I like to ball out at nice restaurants on the regular?)

If you want to do fine dining up right, go to Melisse. At close to $300 a person, it's definitely a destination restaurant, but well worth the splurge.

Even though it was my first time dining at this Santa Monica gem, it will not be my last. I would love to visit again sometime when I have a) a man to take me or b) get my next commission check and am ready and willing to splurge, splurge, splurge"
"My sister came to Los Angeles and decided to treat ourselves to dinner. We decided on Melisse after looking through a couple of restaurants' menus. One thing to note for Melisse is that when you make reservations, they will take your credit card for a deposit fee. This is just to ensure that you don't make a few other reservations and take your pick on the night of the dinner.

We ended up changing our reservation to a different day and Melisse was really good with making adjustments for us.

The moment I stepped into the restaurant, I was greeted by the maitre d'. The waiters were all very courteous and I always appreciate it when they take the time to introduce every course when the food is served.

The food was really good in general. I compared Melisse with Providence, since both restaurants serve French food, and I have to say I preferred Melisse a lot more than Providence. Providence was a bit disappointing to me because the menu was too ordinary. Dinner at Providence did end up with a sweet dessert.

Melisse, on the other hand, was very much a culinary journey from the beginning to the end.

""Ten"" Menu

Grape appetizer
Oyster wrapped with avocado
1. Egg Caviar
2. Wild Japanese Mackerel
3. Spring Onion Veloute
4. Zuckerman Farms Green Asparagus
5. Santa Barbara Spot Prawn
6. Scottish Salmon
7. Liberty Duck Breast
8. Fourme d'Ambert
9. Molten Chocolate Tart
10. Coconut Meringue

Price: $150

Highlights:

Egg Caviar: Really soft, definitely a must-try. Melisse offered two menus, the ""Ten"" and the regular menu, where the Egg Caviar was a $25 supplement. It's definitely worth it to get the ""Ten"" menu.

Scottish Salmon: I'm normally opposed to having fish on the menu. I grew up in the Chinese culture where most of the fish that we eat are steamed (to almost-always perfection) so the meat is tender. Despite my bad feelings about the salmon, Melisse surprised me by serving a piece of salmon that is slightly on the raw side, which retains the tenderness of the meat. I'd say the salmon was perfect.

Little good-bye treat: I love it when fine dining restaurants give you a plate of what I call, ""good-bye treats."" It really sweetens the whole culinary journey at the end.

Disappointments:

Liberty Duck Breast: The meat was not as tender as I hoped. Melisse's service was really nice. When the waitress noticed my discomfort with trying to cut the meat with no success, she immediately asked if anything was wrong and switched my plate for a newly made plate of duck breast. The second plate was not much better. The meat was simply not as tender as I was hoping for.

Fourme d'Ambert: I'm not much of a cheese person. The taste of the cheese was simply too strong for me, but hey, this is only coming from someone who only likes Mozarella.

I would definitely visit Melisse again, if given the opportunity. It was a great experience despite the duck."
great french food. i wish i could have their mango dessert every day!
Amazingly good but painful. My fianc√© and I came here to celebrate our engagement. The food is well curated by the ten course was beyond what I was prepared for. Our waiter was excellent and the ambience is great and romantic. Amazing experience! There is this steamed egg and it was so delish! My favorite part of the meal.
"Came here right around New Year Eve weekend. Felt really luck we got a reservation at a decent time. I loved the decor and service was fantastic. I think the only dish I didn't quite swoon over was the meat dish. Otherwise every dish was a work of art and a treat for my palate. If only I lived in LA, I'd be back more often!"
"Well I can say this I've never been to a restaurant like this before .. first time for everything the atmosphere was great the food amazing ! A total dream our server was Doug he was super professional didn't miss a beat ugh can't wait to come back here for our next celebration
This place is completely worth giving a shot !"
"We opted opted for the 13 course ""Carte Blanche"" tasting menu with wine pairing and truffles. The food was good but not spectacular and not comparable to other fine dining restaurants we have eaten at in Chicago and New York.. Some of the dishes were over-salted and others lacked depth of taste. Our waiter was outstanding but the pacing of each course was uneven. My dining companion commented that when we had a 24 course meal at Alinea in Chicago, were did not want it to end but at Melisse we were ready to go.

Bottom line: Melisse was ""good"" but is overated and over priced."
"We came here to celebrate our engagement and everyone was sooo nice and made us feel super special :)

Wine:
The gave us sparkling wines to start. Our waiter then helped us pick half bottles of red and white. All 3 were complex and well balanced and perfect for the dishes we were served.

Food:
The entire table needs to get the same tasting menu. We went with the 7 course. It was one of the best meals of my life!

2 amuse courses: The second one with the truffle in the corn soup was absolutely incredible. I could eat it everyday.

Caviar egg: My favorite course. The flavors blended together in perfect harmony. Yummy.

Foie gras: Also really really good. Too much for one person. Since foie gras is so creamy and rich, the bread that comes with it probably shouldn't be as drenched in butter as it was.

Prawn: I don't like prawn so don't listen to me about this.

Truffle risotto: Holy shit wowwwww!!!! Get. This.

Salmon: Meh.

Wagyu beef: Amazing cut and perfectly cooked, as expected. The sauce complemented it really well.

Lamb: The lamb itself was good but it came with a veggie stuffed with lamb that I found even better!

Chocolate dessert: Good but not at par with the other courses.

Cheeses: They need to tell me where they shop because I need some of those at home!

Vanilla and strawberry dessert: Perfect end to a perfect meal."
"We are truly disappointed!!! My boyfriend surprised me with dinner and Melisse for my birthday last night. I was impressed by the ambiance and the fact that it is a two star michelin rated restaurant. Nice touch with a birthday card and little box of chocolate welcoming us at the table. We enjoyed the food. We loved all courses, the duck confit and the lobster in particular. It was quite an experience. BUT THE SERVICE WAS HORRENDOUS!!! To start off, it took forever to get our wine but the wine connoisseur apologized for the delay saying he couldn't find the bottle we ordered and providing us with a more expensive option at the same price. After the entree plates were cleared, we waited 25 minutes for dessert with no water, no wine, and no sign of our server. Our server never did return and other staff eventually brought out our dessert and brought us the bill.

My cake was served with an un-lit candle next to it, which is not a big deal. But the fact that 5 other tables who were celebrating their birthdays got their candles lit all the way from the kitchen just showed that they really messed up with our table.

My boyfriend was really disappointed. Again, we did enjoy the food. I decided to tell the new waiter about our experience. He seemed surprised but handled it well. Until then, we still didn't see our server. We are foodies and eat out at new restaurants all the time. This is the FIRST time ever that the server just completely disappeared during our meal and never returned.

We expected a much higher quality of service from a place with as sterling a reputation as Melisse."
"I really had high hopes for this place.

Unfortunately, Melisse missed the bar. Walking in to the restaurant, I saw a ""NO PHOTOGRAPHY/NO PHONES"" sign at the counter. My boyfriend and I decided to respect the restaurants' wishes and refrain from taking any pictures of the food that evening. Looking back, I really wish we had just snuck a few pictures because the meal was not very memorable... :\

We had the carte blanche menu. For the first course, I had the egg caviar and he had the wagyu beef tartare. The second course, I had the lobster bolognese, but neither of us could remember what he had. Maybe salmon? For the entree, we decided to try the 35 day dry aged ""cote de boeuf roti"" with various salts and peppers. For dessert, I had the passion fruit and he had the chocolate souffle. Also some amuse bouches.

I thought the time between each item served was much too long and we were starving for a majority of the dinner. From past experiences with tasting menus, the dishes really need to be served at a timely manner to be able to fully enjoy each component.

The staff were fairly attentive when we first arrived, but as the night went on, service was definitely lacking. When the food finally arrived, I thought the dishes were pretty good. The egg caviar was surprisingly refreshing. The saltiness of the caviar worked well with the richness of the soft boiled egg and the creme fraiche made it lighter. The lobster bolognese had truffle, and I do love truffle. The lobster flavor however was very mild. They carved our steak entree at our table and it looked and smelled delicious. They portioned out the steak between my boyfriend and I, but I don't know if I just received the bulk of the fat and tendon but I thought it was very chewy and tough to eat. I usually prefer lean tender cuts of meat, but I also enjoy buttery/fatty cuts as well. This one was just not edible, I felt like I was only eating fat jelly..... And lastly, dessert was ok.

Considering the price, the food and overall dining experience was not mpressive. Sad to say, I was really expecting more, especially if I am paying $$$$"
"***Melisse is one of the country's very best French fine dining restaurants***

With Los Angeles' mostly casual dining scene, Melisse is one of the city's few options for a traditionally luxurious and indulgent fine dining tasting menu. They serve the kind of tasting menu that showcases both luxury ingredients like caviar and truffle and classic French preparations like foie gras torchon, crepes, souffl√©s, and more. While Melisse is rich in tradition with champagne carts, cheese trolleys and petit fours, it still reflects the California dining scene with Asian influences and an contemporary approach to building satisfying flavor and texture combinations.

Melisse offers a pick-your-own four course menu, but their best option (which is only slightly more expensive than their four course menu) is their ten course tasting menu, which delivers highlights from their bigger menu in smaller but still generous-in-size tasting courses.

Their current summer tasting menu is excellent. It started with a series of amuses including a cherry tomato rolled in goat cheese and pistachios, a tomato gel exploding with sweetness, housemade apricot soda, and a raw oyster bathed in a sour lettuce jus and topped with ice lettuce and really fun and unique sea grapes.

The first course was a true classic--a slow poached egg yolk topped with lemon cr√®me fraiche, caviar and chives. The egg was served with buttery and crisp pastry to provide a nice texture contrast to the soft egg course, which exploded with a rich egg yolk, a light cr√®me fraiche, great freshness from lemon, and salty and tasting of the ocean caviar. This type of egg caviar course can be found in many great restaurants across in the country (in many different interpretations), and Melisse's version is one of the very best.

Up next was a caprese salad of heirloom tomatoes and burrata that was intensified with very fragrant basil and really good white chocolate crisps. There was also a great sweet corn soup garnished with chanterelles (great flavor and nicely cooked to keep the unique texture of this mushroom) and the perfect contrast of whipped black truffle mousse.

A modern preparation of foie gras torchon came next. Melisse does an excellent job of serving foie gras torchon at just the right temperature that delivers richness but also an unbelievable softness that tops torchons found at even the country's best French restaurants. There were excellent garnishes here like Persian mulberries and perfectly sweet and sour Meyer lemon jam.

A really well cooked Santa Barbara spot prawn followed, which was exceptionally well cooked with a perfect soft texture and excellent natural sweetness that overshadowed the lacking in flavor garnishes that accompanied it. I added a supplemental course of sweet corn agnolotti with black truffle--excellent housemade pasta and a great contrast of amazingly sweet corn and earthy and fragrant black truffle.

Wild King Salmon was next, and I loved the cook on it. It was a perfect medium rare but still with a great flakiness. I really liked the addition of summer pole beans, lobster mushrooms and the rich buttery and lemon grenobloise sauce though I felt the fried capers were a tad too pungent. My main course, which was very moist rabbit loin wrapped in Parma ham and served atop really well prepared beans where you can still identify the texture. The other additions on the course was in the good but not excellent range with the exception of the mini rack of rabbit, which is one of the true underappreciated cuts of anything (and Melisse's preparation revealed this cut's excellent combination of moistness and richness but still lean meat).

Next was a series of cheese and dessert courses (including crepes with peaches, rose petals, ice cream, and buttermilk), and they were all satisfying though I think with a few small alterations to the modern blue cheese and fig Danish to highlight the sweetness of the fig and the pungent blue cheese flavor, it could have been elevated to one of the very best cheese courses in the country.

Service led by general manager James is always excellent--polished and professional but always personable and friendly. Melisse's prices are in line with other top rated fine dining restaurants though you probably get more courses and larger portion sizes at Melisse than at those other fine dining establishments.

Melisse is a standout in Los Angeles, and I prefer it to many of the top French fine dining restaurants in the country like New York's Daniel and the Bay Area's La Toque, La Folie and Gary Danko. It does not quite rich the amazing presentations and push-the-envelope courses of Quince and Baume, but Melisse's ability to seamlessly integrate tradition, luxury ingredients, seasonal and local produce, and contemporary techniques makes it a must experience for residents and visitors who appreciate fine dining cuisine.

Street parking is available."
"Overrated, overpriced and food that pretty much guarantees acid reflux"
"Several courses, very expensive, outstanding service. Food to die for."
"one of the best meals I've had. I've only been here a few times so I can't speak to the daily consistency but my meals were fantastic and service was superb. we sat next to the fireplace and felt as if the chef was only cooking for us! What seams like a three hour meal was perfect and balanced. Thank you Chef, we'll be back!"
"We've come here several times over the past few years and Chef Citrin's ingenuity never ceases to amaze me. The complexity and flavor layering of his dishes are intense. He's able to combine seemingly disparate ingredients, often times obscure but locally sourced, into phenomenal dishes.

The egg caviar starter has been a staple on his menu for years and shows how a humble product can be turned into something great (ok, with help from caviar). Another standout was the green tomato broth with eggplant foam. The broth was absolutely amazing especially the clarity and depth of flavor. Again, a humble product shines.

Service is formal, unobtrusive, and carefully orchestrated, which is entirely appropriate given the multi-hour experience and expense. It was such a memorable meal that I think back to the Melisse meals months later."
"Thankfully with the help of the coronavirus pandemic, I finally get to try Melisse and Citrin. With the magic of take-out, it's a Melisse x Citrin dinner. For 2, it's $118. $25 for an extra cheese plate. Much cheaper than eating in-person.

No traffic on a weekday night. Lots of street parking was available with hardly any walking necessary. There was no need to park, it's a drive-through pickup at their usual valet area. There was a ample room to park if you have to wait a bit.

Basil brioche: soft, very green. Butter was already soft.
Lobster Bolognese: I love the detailed reheating instructions. Very rich, especially with the added brown butter truffle sauce.
Duo of Beef: ahh the beef tongue was soft. Filet mignon was not overcooked even with it sitting in the to-go box for like an hour. A benefit of eating at home: no embarrassment adding Tabasco or Tapatio.
Crepes layered with 5 flavors of chocolate: yes best refrigerated and cold.
Cheese plate: includes 5 cheeses. The box label doesn't include cheese names. Also included are walnuts, some kind of sweet liquids, and bread."
"Ive been wanting to try Melisse for quite a long time now. Read alot about how great this place was and this was the last of the 3 Michelin 2 Star rated restaurant in LA that I had yet to try. Lucky for me, I got treated out for my bday. Now that my cycle is complete, I realize I'm not really a fan of any of the Michelin 2 Stars. I prefer several of the 1 Stars quite a bit more.

I will say service here is SUPERB. Food is just okay. Outside of the presentation, nothing really blew my mind.

And just like the decor, I'll leave my review : plain , simple, and quite unimpressive."
"I had wanted to eat at Melisse for 4 years; but was hesitant because of the prices. We decided to splurge for my birthday and oh.....was it worth the wait. I originally went to have their $65 anniversary tasting special back in July; but after looking the menu over, we decided to go for the gusto with the 10-course. And then....my head exploded. This is the closest I have ever come to having an orgasm over food. Seriously. The best meal of my life. We did several wine pairings which were spectacular and added the lobster bolognaise to our meal; so in total, we had 11 courses. Needless to say we were stuffed; but well worth it. My favorite course was the poached egg with caviar...it was so creamy and delicious; I have no idea how it was cooked. Amazing! But beware; this meal comes at a price....a cool $500 so start saving now!!!"
"Me and Mrs. me ate there tonight on our 21st anniversary. We grilled our foodie friends and decided to go to Melisse based on a 5-4 vote. We called ahead and informed the restaurant that I do not eat goat cheese, which they mad note of. We had our fingers crossed hoping that the experience would rival that which we had a the L'Auberge du Pere Bise in Talloires on the shore of Lake Annecy, France some time ago. Sorry Charlie, no cigar.

Upon seating, the waitress brought a small, complimentary welcome appetizer only for my wife and not for me because it contained goat cheese. Thank you for remembering and shame on you for not using the chef's near legendary creativity to bring me something similar. This felt like a shot across our bow and was really a classless gesture on their part

Look, the service and everything were pretty much top notch, but the food was, well, at $105 weak American dollars per, for the tasting menu, was as weak as our currency. There were some decent tastes, but really, the dishes were as related as 5 strangers in the center section seats on a trans-Atlantic flight on a wide bodied jet. After much grilling I fell for the waitresses suggestion to start with the onion soup with crab stuff in the middle. What I got was a bowl with some crispy crab cake and cooked lump crab meat surrounded by parmasean and onion flavored cream. It did have some flavor, but after a few spoonfuls, I swapped with my wife for her excellent fois gras combo. Next stop was the second dish. Wow, a chunk of cooked salmon, one inch wide by one inch tall by 2 3/4 inches long, served with, well I can't remember and it was only 4 hours ago. Okay, there were some veggies present. My wife loved the vegs surrounding her John Dory, but the fish was just fish.

Next dish was the entree, which, excuse my ignorance, was what the previous dish could have been called. She had the beef and I had the lamb. The lamb was very good, but it was served with some ultra salty veggie that I now remember was eggplant. The lamb tasted like decent but not special lamb that you get at your average overpriced eatery where the chefs get away with going through the motions because the patrons are really there just to be scene and not herd.

My wife, who is the most honest person on the planet and who loves everyone and every thing, thought the beef was just beefy and far from special. I finished her beef and it was a bit chewy, not melt-in-your-mouth wonderful and succulent like you'd expect at a two asterisk Michelin grade spot. Last were the desserts. I had the chocolate assortment that has the word chocolate written three times as its name on the menu and boy was it better than average. It really tasted better than anything you could buy at a 711 or even at a pastry shop in the parts of LA where people double park their S class Benzes so their nannies can run in an pick up some sweets. My wife had some other dessert choice that she thought was just okay, something with raspberry soup.

Overall, if Melisse is typical of how Michelin rates eateries, then Michelin should stick to tires. Dietetically, and not from the weight gain or loss angle, the meal sucked. Way too few veggies. Way too little fiber and way too much salt. Meliisse reminds me of the ""Emperor's New Clothes"" in a bizarre way, where all the patrons are actually sitting there nude, drinking red dyed water out of expensive glasses and eating nicely presented food, secretly prepared in the kitched after being scooped from cans and frozen TV dinner trays.

We had a wonderful time and hopefully Melisse will give $225 of the $300 cheque total to a deserving charity."
"I've only been here twice, but both visits were transformative experiences. After ordering off of the Ten menu the first time, I vowed, VOWED, that my next visit would indulge in the Carte Blanche menu... and I did and it was beyond description and expectation. Treat yourself, live, and celebrate in the wonderment of Meslisse."
"Took forever to get a reservation but it was worth it. Reserves and prepay first on Tock. Base price for 2 people is $800, then you can get any add ons you wish.

Service was great as expected. The food was obviously delicious but also so creative with the choices and mixes. 20 courses. Licked every plate clean.

Will be back."
"We have been here twice now, and both evenings have been complete perfection. The interior of the restaurant is quirky; a combination of old school high-end details like floor-length tablecloths and glass table decorations with some local touches like black and white venice beach photographs. The service is impeccable; friendly but also still formal in a way that reminds you that your dinner is a special occasion. We have gotten the 7 course meal both times - we went this time for Dine LA, but couldn't help but get a bigger menu because we loved the food so much last time. The caviar egg is not to be missed. It might be the best unique dish on the west side. I think about it more than I'd like to admit. Every bit of food and drink we've had there has been memorable and perfect. It is somewhere we'll return to as often as we can."
"Of course, one expects utter perfection from a night a Melisse. The service, the food, the environment...at this tier of dining, anything short of spectacular is an exponentially more distressing than if, say, your order at chipotle is off. Naturally, the entire 3.5 hours we spent enjoying ""Ten"" with wine pairing was a joyous celebration of the art of food and the lost art of fine dining service. If you're coming here expecting to experience the avant garde of molecular gastronomy, you're in the wrong place. But what they do serve - classically-executed French/Cali cuisine - is strangely reassuring in an age where your dessert can come floating in the air. That being said, some dishes fell flat, and this was surprising. The beef cheek was more sinewy than succulent; the black cod was so hopelessly underwhelming I couldn't even remember it until I reviewed the photos. Perhaps a victim of unreasonable expectations, the fact that not everything coming from the kitchen was an absolute home run was really too bad. And the service also seemed rushed at times, with the sommelier looking a bit breathless at times and unwilling or unable to answer some more detailed inquiries into the wine and the food. That all being said, the meal remains a shining example of what food and the dining experience can and should aspire to be, and to become."
"After a second time at Melisse, I'm strongly sticking with 4 stars.

I have also learned that I just can't order multiple course tasting menus anymore; I get too stuffed!

Months ago, I had made my reservation at Melisse for June 30; the last night of Foie Freedom. I wanted to fete the foie in style, bid au revoir in an appropriate way, and I felt Melisse was the way to do it. Rather than belabor the menu, as you can't order it now anyway, some of the things that stood out most from the evening:

-Sommelier Brian is amazing! He seems like such an interesting guy; even before I knew he was the sommelier, he commands your attention in the dining room. Hair just a bit disheveled (but in the ""I styled it this way on purpose"" look), total confidence as he struts about the room, very laid-back conversational style (while not ever losing the appropriate formality). On top of all that, Jim G. gave him some guidelines on wine and he recommended an outstanding bottle. Once I can find a place that sells it, I'm buying some!
-Servers were friendly and had done their homework! One of the hostesses had called me about a month or so prior to the reservation, inquiring if we were thinking of choosing the Foie for All menu or not. They were considering how to prepare for the evening and were asking all guests with reservations that night. I mentioned that we were, but that I would be sad if I couldn't order an Egg Caviar. =) As our server was checking in with us, he asked if we were interested in the Foie menu, but then followed up by saying, ""And some Egg Caviar, yes?"" I love that kind of attention to detail. I thought Jim G. and I would share one; they brought two. It was nice not to share, to be honest. However, I did not expect that each one would be $45!!! It's a $20 supplement charge on their 4 course meal, so why wouldn't it be a $20 supplement charge on the Foie for All 8 course meal? I did not like that.
-Bussers/Food Runners: These boys need some work! There were a couple different gentlemen who presented us with some of our dishes and, apparently, told us what they were, what was in them, where on the plate the different sauces were, etc. I say apparently since they were nearly impossible to understand, with their very thick accents. At one point, a food runner dropped off our plate, turned around and grabbed some other guy, and said, ""Can you tell them?"" and took off. This 'new' guy seemed like a head waiter or manager or something. He told us what we had before us, and jokingly said, ""Thankfully I knew what was on the plate!"" He seemed a bit embarrassed at his co-worker's behavior, as he should be. Also, early on in the meal, one of the bussers eagerly tried to take my Egg Caviar long before it was done; I had put my spoon down for a moment to savor my champagne. I said to him, ""No, no, no. I'm not done yet. Thanks."" No joke, every time after that, this busser waited for our server to be nearby, gave him a look like, ""Now?"" and then the server would ask, ""May we take these from you,"" and he and the busser would clear the dishes. It's like I traumatized him by not letting him take my $45 egg away before I was done! The service and language issues of the bussers and food runners brought the experience much lower than it should have been.
-When we were presented menus for the evening, I inquired whether Chef would be willing to sign one (I had asked the hostess earlier and she said, of course). Our server said that it might be a little bit, as he was finishing up some things in the kitchen, but of course. About 10-15 minutes later, Chef de Cuisine Takayama comes over. Now, I was pleased to meet him, chat with him about the meal, and have him sign my menu; however, I expected Chef Citrin. I was surprised that either Chef Citrin wasn't at his own restaurant on the last night of Foie Gras or that he was unwilling to come out and say hello to a nearly empty dining room (it was quite late by this time). Bummer. But, Chef Takayama was great!

-Somewhat unrelated to the dinner, but it did stand out: I really, really covet Birkin bags! This woman had one, and I couldn't stop looking at it!

Au Revoir Foie!"
"Celebrating my husband's birthday and our 20th wedding anniversary, we decided to shell out for what promised to be an amazing culinary experience. We were not disappointed!
We arrived a bit early and met some of the other diners while we waited for the staggered seating/service. This actually was a great thing because I found out some fellow diners were from my hometown of Philadelphia so we had some light happy chatter before being seated.
Since we chose one of the first dining times I was able to eavesdrop on the waitstaff having their pre-game huddle which they ended with a team cheer. It surprised me for such a formal place, but I liked that their little moment was to unify the staff to give the diners the best experience. It's great to see professional pride in your job. Nothing wrong with that and it's refreshing.
The dress is more formal and men are encouraged to wear a dinner jacket. As much as I hate to wear dresses, I enjoyed being graceful and demure for one evening. lol
We were seated in what we think is the ""newbie waiter"" section:
The tables close to us were full of younger diners, some oblivious to the ""no cell phone"" rule. The women next to us chose the wine pairing and got drunk and loud and cursed, so that was a bit of a downer.
When our waiter found out we had been married so long he faltered, and made some strange mistakes like forgetting we had the 10 course and almost refusing us the cheese plate that was supposed to be next. He apologized and made up for it, but these things happen to us frequently because 1) my purple hair and 2) no one believes we've been married so long because we're pretty youthful I guess.
But this shouldn't take away from the overall review, but it gave us an insight into how they arrange their seating. This bums me out a bit as we were seated with people who are less likely to appreciate the food and a lot of my enjoyment at places like these is to see the reactions of other diners to their choices...
We chose the 10 course. With the option of the book signed by the chef(s). It was the best way to really sample what the chefs are thinking and concocting. I have to say I was amazed just thinking of the preparation that must go into every dish. There is a lot of love and care. I did NOT go for the wine pairing, as I get migraines now. So excuse my half review, but I prefer beer anyway. I did get two cocktails though and the one with egg cream was delectable!
My absolute favorite was the Egg Caviar (Soft Poached Egg, Lemon Cr√®me Fra√Æche, American Caviar). INCROYABLE. It is right up there with my all time favorite Morimoto's toro tartare. Everything else paled in comparison. I felt my face melt a bit with each bite, my head would loll back a bit and I'd breathe a sigh of ecstasy. Not too loud, but wow, pure food love.
Twice Cooked Foie Gras - cherries! Hee hee! It makes you feel decadently evil! There are turnips in these which led to our having a conversation on the semi-maligned turnip. I need to do more turnip research. WHO THE HELL SAYS THAT AFTER EATING? This must be a good thing.
The Caprese Salad was maybe the second best? You'd think it would be a simple affair but it had a lot more depth and prep than you'd think. Each bite was wonderful.
Sweet Corn Soup was amazing. Tender, sweet in spurts, like that scene in Ratatouille where you taste it and are transported back to when you are a child and it leaves you with a feeling like your mother has just hugged away all your worries. It gave me that womb-like feelng of security and all is right in the world. SoCal drought? Trump running for President? WHO CARES. THIS SOUP FIXES EVERYTHING.
I picked the Truffle Risotto over the Prawn. It was exactly like I thought it would taste, homey and rustic and the unforgettable smoothness of truffle - like 70s Billy Dee Williams comes sidling up and just impregnates you without knowing. For fans of nuance, the buttery richness of this dish is sure to please.
The Maine Halibut. OK I am not a fan of how America does fish. In my mind you can't do better than fresh caught fish with salt, pepper and some olive oil. A wedge of lime. I feel like people are always trying to eradicate the fish taste and replace it with some gross evil lab concoction. That being said, halibut was ok, it was not horrendous but ultimately disappointing. I think I actually pouted when no one was looking. I think this is when the girls next to us were well on their way to drunk and started cursing so this was the all-time low of the evening. This was the only time I felt that we were paying quite a bit of money and I should be able to get up and physically assault these women and be applauded for it.
Next I chose the Flat Iron Steak over the Veal Loin. I was trying to save stomach space at this point so I only took a bite or two. Tender and giving, it was great but I should have chosen the Veal to have compared it with Carlos' Steak. Argh."
Best meal of my life. No corkage fee as long as you buy one bottle there.
"Chef Josiah and his assistant Ken are really connecting with my taste and style since we started eating there again after a 10 year hiatus .... long story there .... but all is good now. I just love that private room and the food is really really good. I guess at $200/person (I always ask for the best), the food better be good."
"one of my favorite places for date night in LA. Well worth the drive from OC. We do the 10 course menu. Chef Josiah often stops by to say hi. We also supported the restaurant and bought his cookbook. Love Love this restaurant. One time, we had new year's eve dinner, and that didn't disappoint, like so many on a holiday evening."
"Went on a Tuesday or something during the day and had a pretty alright experience, nothing as one would expect from all the amazing reviews and accolades they recieve. I really was expecting a divine treat with magical service but it just wasn't the case.

The food was da' bomb, obviously. But the service was certainly not what one would expect from the 'Best restaurant in SoCal'.

The ambiance is a delight and our dishes tantalized our tastebuds. But I've had better.

Perhaps it's not fair to give stars based on expectations as opposed to experience but that's what's happening."
"We love coming here for special occasions!! We have been 3 times so far and it's been so
Special each time. The chef and the staff put so much thought and effort into everything here and it shows!! They ask that you arrive promptly as all the dishes come out at the same time for the whole restaurant and its customers. They have a wine pairing and a mock tail pairing. Both are amazing! Each time we have went the menu was different and I loved that even the artwork on the walls has changed. The waiters explain everything you're eating and drinking down to the tee and it's appreciated. They will even announce to the whole restaurant certain details about specific dishes as well. The whole experience is about 3 hours and you leave STUFFED!! I can't wait to come back and see what new amazing menu the chef and his talented team whip up"
"Exquisite food? Yup.

Impeccable service? Not quite.
Elegant ambience? Nope.

The food here was wonderful. But as a two-star Michelin restaurant, I hold it up to very high standards. The restaurant is more suited for families and/or friends celebrating. It's not that good a place for a couple wanting to have a romantic evening.

They did all the right things to make this a Michelin restaurant -- offered champagne when we were seated and served our dishes simultaneously. But at the same time, I noticed my menu and a napkin was dirty. Not a big deal, but it's like that study where they went into 4 star hotels, put a little mark on the sheets to check that maids did change sheets, and some of the hotels failed. It's just a little click in your brain that says this restaurant isn't that fastidious.

While eating here, I couldn't but help compare it to Gary Danko's in San Francisco. I prefer Gary Danko's --they don't nickel and dime you ($105 base price for tasting menu, then add $5-$20 supplement for ""special'"" dishes -- and most dishes are special.)

Wonderful food though. Didn't regret going, just not sure if I'd go back on my own dime. (Heehee-- I just glanced at some other reviews and Alex C. says the same thing.)

$500 for 2 people after tax and tip. (2 base menus at $105 each, 1 wine pairing ($75), and a whole lot of supplements)"
"Finally made it to thee other 2 Michelin Star restaurant in Los Angeles (at least according to 2009 guide when LA was still included). As always, my expectations go up a notch whenever dining at these fine establishments where often ... their reputation precedes themselves.

I had heard wonderful things about Melisse and I wanted to sample as much of the cuisine as possible and accordingly opted for their ""Sample '10' Menu"". Be forewarned that this tasting course will last for about a minimum of three hours .... so plan accordingly. The dining room reeks of sophistication though I did not find the room ""stuffy"" or ""formal"" as some people have described. The room was in fact quite noisy ... certainly not Bottega Louie level ... but the chatter was louder than I had expected. Honestly, I assumed that I would be whispering during the entire dinner service for fear that I might be deemed uncouth or ill-mannered and be reprimanded accordingly by the other ""more sophisticated"" dining patrons. Luckily, this scenario did not come to fruition.

Highlights of the 10 menu included:
Egg Caviar with lemon creme fraiche (simple ... yet equally amazing in flavor and presentation)
Seared foie gras with pineapple (wonderful pairing and seared to perfection)
Black Bass ""en ecailles"" (the scales elevated the dish to another level)
Wagyu prime rib with braised beef cheeks with shaved black truffles (I will explain)
Pont L'Eveque Tart
Chocolate chocolate chocolate dessert

Unfortunately, I was not too impressed with the wild Japanese Kanpachi nor the abalone and the rest were just ""good"". We originally ordered the risotto with black truffles ... however due to some miscommunication with the kichen it unfortunately did not make the table. The gracious host and waiter sincerely apologized and offered to shave some truffles over the ribeye and that is how we ended up with that particular dish. I was a little disappointed at the miscue, however, the staff more than made up for the oversight. Service overall was tremendous ... one of the best really ... certainly on par with Le Bernardin.

Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience ... service and ambience were on point as well as some if not most of the dishes in their tasting menu. Unfortunately, I cannot give it a 5 star rating (3.5 really ... but we're splitting hairs at this point). I believe it's worthy of all it's accolades including it's MIchelin Stars ... however, given the choice ... I would rather go to Providence. I realize that it's not quite a fair comparison but it's difficult not to given how rare these stars are awarded in Southern California."
"Amazing dinner, they certainly deserve their two Michelin Stars and maybe even three. The service is impressive, informed, polite, but not stuffy or pretentious. The food was outstanding and the cheese course is not to be missed. We were offered perfect wine suggestions as well. Definitely the place to go for a special occasion."
"Have you ever enjoyed a meal to the point of getting teary eyed? This was our experience tonight.

Everything from the food to service and atmosphere was beyond what we had ever experienced. Each course was a work of art, worthy of admiration... we will definitely be back any chance we get. Definitely worth every penny and more."
"This restaurant is worth the $$$. Perfect for a birthday celebration to make a special someone feel...well...very special! They can accomodate all party sizes. I ordered the chicken for 2 and I never knew chicken could be so scrumptious. Usually, I'm weirded out by the whole foam on food trend but these flavors were outstanding."
"Not family friendly and prices absurd. When I brought my kids the looks and stares not to mention attitude was unreal. They have a $185 tasting menu with numerous items I would not consume plus upgrades to items I would that cost as much as $35 each! You cannot order individual items! Figure $250 per person with a drink or two. Maybe I am spoiled in Las Vegas but here you can dine at the best French Restaurant with amazing views of the strip form 56th floor at Alize, order what you want and have a far better meal for $100 per person not to mention a far nicer atmosphere and view!"
"If you want to get the most out of Melisse, forget about the 4 course (commoners tasting menu) or the 10 course ""anniversary"" tasting menu.

We had the carte blanche which consists of 13 courses at 200pp +95pp for wine pairing. And for the first time we were stuffed from a French meal. Some light eaters might even get full when reaching the savory courses.

Our dinner took us almost 4 hours, with only about 5mins between courses. Their timing was perfect.

The Carte Blanche menu is seasonal/chef's choice, so what you get will vary. You'll get a few signature dishes (egg caviar, Fennel Flan, Chocolate, Chocolate, Chocolate) found on the regular menu, along with the following that is worth mentioning: Trio of Foie Gras, Crispy Frogs leg, John Dori, Lobster w/white truffles, true wagyu beef.)

For the money it was certainly worth it."
"We snagged a late reservation during dineLA week and had a great time. The amuse bouche was a grape stuffed with goat cheese topped with pistachio and it was really good. The oysters with pomegranate(?) foam were super clean, fresh, and light. For our first course I had the beef tartare and the BF had their soup with crabmeat. The soup was the better choice. The beef tartare was good but I wasn't a fan of the crispy texture on top. For my next course I had the truffle risotto. The part where they came by with a fresh black truffle to shave it on top was awesome. The waiter pretended to look around first before shaving it a couple extra times :)

I really liked my beef rib main entree but the BF said it was only ok. The barbecue sauce (apparently a secret recipe) was delicious. Although it was good, it was pretty much just a refined, elevated version of beef ribs. Nothing too exciting or out of the box. The quail was also lovely, but we were a little spoiled by another quail we had (La Folie in SF) and thought the other one was better.

The coffee/chocolate dessert was a great end to the meal. The flavor of the ice cream hit the spot and the coffee panna cotta was solid. The chocolate was a little rich for me but all in all it was a success. DineLA was the perfect opportunity to try the place, and now I can't wait to come back again."
"5 stars because I couldn't find anything to criticize really. Made reservations via opentable which made the process very simple and received a confirmation call on Thursday prior to our 6pm Saturday dinner.
We arrived and went inside to check in. We were seated immediately and wished a happy anniversary, brought homemade truffles in decorative boxes as a gift from the restaurant and were brought water while we perused the menu. We had every intention of trying the 10 but due to a shellfish allergy we opted for the 4.

Every dish had a unique taste of its own. Some may say they were not wowed but if u take the time to taste all the flavors on the plate I find that hard to believe.

My favorite was the lobster bolognese and the prawn. The steak was done to perfection and the beef cheek it was served with was sensational. We wanted the cheese cart but changed our mind after filling up on the 5 different breads.

We ended the meal with the chocolate and salted caramel dessert and because we really wanted to try the Nutella crunch which came only with the ten, the waitress brought out a piece to make sure we didn't leave without having a taste of it. It was delicious!

Finally yes the bill was about $400 including wine, coffee and water. But it's our anniversary and that's how we roll. My husband didn't like the 3% charge for health insurance but if the restaurant won't pay for it and feels the diners should so be it. I'll pay it during my one time visit.

You must try this place at least once in your life. Treat yourself every now & then. Not too often, otherwise it's no longer a treat!"
"Fantastic. I enjoyed the food more than my favorite similar quality restaurants back home. Definitely worth the cost, for me. Standouts were the egg caviar, chawan mushi, and beef tartare. And the cherimoya dessert. Excellent service from all the team members, without being stuffy or stiff. Just a wonderful experience all around."
"We met our friends for a celebration here on a Friday evening. My wife and I arrived first and waited at the lobby counter. Big Hollywood director enters solo and is seated by the familiar staff in a tucked away corner in the plush main dining room. We're seated at a four-top next to the wall at the well of the main dining room, near the silent sliding doors into the kitchen. We have early reservations. Reservations are a must.

The staff explain the menu options. Tonight is the last night of visiting French chef Christophe Dufau. He has prepared the special 10-course tonight.

The staff suggest I discuss the wine with their sommelier, Brian. He knows his wine, suggests a French bottle--very reasonable to very unattainable is offered. The flavor is exactly as promised. It barely lasts between the two men through the four hour ten and more courses.

Chef Dufau pulls out everything in the kitchen and ten courses is preceded by and followed by treats and small desserts and more. If ordering any truffles be sure to pay attention and sniff the truffles when they bring out the box. Each course is presented by staff--announced and described. The presentation--including even the dishes served on--is wonderful.

About the food. Amazing, of course, as the French would say. The house favorite--poached egg with caviar is perfect in so many ways."
"Honestly I don't get the praises.

Overall it was a pleasant experience but the wait for each course was longer than I am used to at French fine dining restaurants and the food was slightly too salty/overwhelming flavor.

Perhaps it's just my palate but I've been to three michelin stars and a variety of these types of places in different cities to know what to expect.
Every dish was slightly more salty or sweet than I wanted and on the black truffle ravioli I could barely taste the truffle...

Since we are in LA, where we have a few great other options, I will probably not be back."
"An exceptional restaurant! My boyfriend's mother and step-father visited from Hawaii last weekend; they researched in advance, and planned their visit around trying the best foods in LA--which, of course, included Melisse.

Not only was the food here amazing, but the service was incredible--very attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable staff.

We all ordered the four course menu. Everything was delicious! I had the seasonal vegetables, lobster Bolognese, Elysian Farms lamb, and chocolate dessert. I can't begin to explain how even the seemingly simple seasonal vegetables dish was so delicious--every bite had a unique taste that was fresh and flavorful. The lobster Bolognese was the least impressive--tasty, but with little lobster flavor. However, for a dessert-lover like me, the ""Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate"" dessert made up for it!"
"For us, a once in a lifetime experience made possible by a gift from generous friends. The Tasting Menu is two and a half hours of how the world could be if everyone paid attention to what they were doing and took pride in doing it. Kabuki theater where the food is prepared in front of you served by two servers and explained by a third. Don't stress if you didn't get it all as they give you a menu and parting gift on the way out. 10 changes of flatware and settings, all matching the foods you are marveling over. There is a sound track playing and it matches the cuisine which you are aware of but most of your mental energy is devoted to sight, smell and taste. Art meets food and food meets perfection. My son and I sat center stage front row and the only comment we made to each other is, ""Are you tasting what I am tasting?"" Marvelous."
"There is nothing my family and I love more than amazing meals with unique flavors, great service and 'iron chef' quality experiences. We've dined at some amazing places in LA, NYC, Tokyo, Paris, Montreal... but Melisse TOPS them all. It's always refreshing to go to a top notch restaurant where you'd expect snobby, elite and stuck up service and be surprised by friendly, down to earth, FUN and helpful staff. The service and staff are by far the best i've ever experienced and the FOOD - omg the FOOOOD is to die for. a MUST if you are in los angeles for the best meal you'll ever have!!"
"Ah, Melisse. The bf took me here for our anniversary dinner, man I wish it was our anniversary again! :) Agree with Noel K. that they do wish you happy anniversary upon arrival and they put a little sign stating the same sentiments on your table. Speaks volumes, right? and they pull a New York and do a coat check upon arrival as well. Super sweet staff, as expected from such a highly rated restaurant.

We did the regular tasting menu and the vegetarian tasting menu. Both were equally and amazingly delicious. The vegeatrian tasting menu has been rated by LA Magazine as the best veg. tasting menu in the city. I stand by this decision! Started off with some amazing artichoke soup with tomato confit and parmesan croquettes. I still salivate when I think about it. BF even raved about this one. Had two different courses of pasta, Herbed Burrata Ravioli and Butternut Squash Ravioli which were amazing, melt-in-your-mouth pasta. Also had the cheese selection... I am not big on the foreign cheeses, I would prefer to stick with my Brie, Havarti, Cheddar, Jack. I suppose it would be great if you liked that stuff. They freshly crack walnuts for you and make a huge display of cutting you cheeses though, which is super fun. Lastly, my dessert was the MOST amazing dessert I have ever had, which is saying a lot because I love dessert! Passion fruit parfait, coconut sorbet, pistachios, lemongrass. It was light, extremely flavorful, and not overpowering. We also tried the chocolate sampler which was too sweet and rich after such a great meal.

I remember the BF had Lobster Bolognese and Trio of Prime Beef. I cannot remember the third, but I do remember a huge ""purse"" with a chunk of meat in it... I think the purse was made of Filo dough. Not a huge Filo dough fan. But I can say this was the slowest I have ever seen this man eat, which indicates it was a delicious meal as he was savoring every bite. Agree with the reviews that the only con is the price. But hey, you get what you pay for!

All in all, I would so eat here again, if only for that passionfruit dessert. Can you do that?

Deliciousness Factor = A+"
"Top 5 Dinners of my LIFE.

The 10-course is apparently the Yelp favorite; I loved it, much more so than what Providence had to offer. The service was impeccable - complete with the whole simultaneous dropping off of plates and lifting of lids....

And yes, the wine pairing is worth it. Nice, generous pours, just the way I like it :)"
"My wife and I had an amazing time about five years ago. We were literally blown away and Melisse was on top of our list for splurge dining so we were very excited to be coming back. Unfortunately our recent visit was disappointing to say the least. For almost a $500 meal for two people, you would expect Four Seasons level service.

The hostess seemed to have something up her deriere and she did not smile or welcome us. Instead, we were more like a nuisance it seemed. She kept us standing in the entrance without any explanation for longer than seemed necessary. Ok, fine, they had to work something out. Then, when we finally got to our booth, some guy, which I would compare to a greasy car salesman, started his pitch to upsell the additional items on the menu. I'll call him Gaston, as he reminded me of the character from Beauty and the Beast. And we couldn't really tell if he was our waiter or what since he didn't explain who the heck he was. I'll give him that he was impeccably dressed. We thought he was some kind of manager sent in to ""close the deal."" The other problem was that he did not explain how the menu worked but kept pushing us to order. And, he did the clicking of the pen thing. You know, when you're in a hurry and you need to click your pen a few times to make time pass. What the? Any way, every time he came by, it was greasiness. The other wait staff were professional and pleasant, the way it was supposed to be.

As for the food, it was pretty good. The other reviews cover it pretty well.

My wife and I separately came to the conclusion that we probably won't be coming back any time soon. We both had the kind of feeling you get after a long battle at the car dealership, not the kind of feeling we should have had after a fine dining experience. Very dissapointing since it was my wife's birthday. Now I have to make up for it!!!!"
"I never write reviews, but I just opened an account to express a bad experience elsewhere and so decided to write about my experience at Melisse last night which was the polar opposite.

We were in Los Angeles for my birthday from Orange County and wanted to go to a nice French restaurant. I always jump on the opportunity to go to a fine French restaurant when traveling since a) it's my favorite and b) there are none in OC. My favorite of all time is Joel Robuchon in Vegas, and Melisse actually ended up being a ""mini-me"" of Joel. I kind of wanted to ask the chef if he studied under him.

The table was beautifully set with a ""Happy Birthday"" card and a little box of chocolate truffles. Nice touch. My spouse and I both decided on the 4 course menus. We really wanted the chicken also that they bring out and carve table side like a Thanksgiving dinner, partially to compare it to the one at Joel Robuchon and partially because we heard it was delicious, so we asked if we could somehow fit it into the menu. The waiter said it would be an obscene amount of food, but we're crazy like that, and we were thrilled that he was so accommodating and was able to let one of us sub it out for one of the courses in our menu. The chicken did NOT disappoint. It was beautiful and super succulent. Like at Joel, they serve the white meat first and then bring a whole 'nother round of dark meat after. The chicken that keeps on giving. From our 4 course menu, the stand outs were the sweet onion Parmesan soup with a delicious crab cake in the middle and the Truffle Tagliatelle. The tagliatelle was a $55 supplement but was totally worth it. Handmade pasta and a truffle taken out of a humidor that took a few servers to hold, handle, and shave a huge mound on top. I had the server pair wines with mine, and they were superb.
The six different types of bread were all great, the best being the basil and then the French country.

The waiter was a little quirky, but made for overall good entertainment for the evening for my spouse and myself. He had the deep voice of an auctioneer and seemed to like to hear himself talk, but at the same time everything he said he would walk away at the end of the sentence. He seemed a little hyper and intense in the beginning, but after realizing it was just his personality and he was a good guy, we settled in. Overall, a wonderful experience!"
"I have had the pleasure of eating here on three different occasions and every meal has been outstanding. I had the tasting menu and without a doubt, each time it has been better than the last. The staff is the most professional I have seen in Los Angeles. When you say find dining, you should think of Melisse. Really a treat worth it!"
"The ambiance was nice, private, modern vibe, minimalist and warm. Service was great. The food was good. I got the 4 course vegetarian hidden menu, I liked most of it however it runs on the heavy and eggy side for my taste (typical French food style). The M√©lisse tea you get at the end of the meal is amazing. Soup is great. Portions: is too big for me, I couldn't finish it and got some help on it. They offered delicious chocolate prior and at the end of the meal. It was our anniversary and my husband loves gourmet food, I personally wouldn't choose to go there, too fancy for my taste."
"This restaurant would be in my top 10 dining experiences ever! Wow! The service from the moment we walked in the door was impeccable. The food and the presentation were also impeccable. Each dish was extremely creative and absolutely delicious. Our waiter was charming, attentive and not obtrusive. The wine he recommended was fabulous. The decor is beautiful high end hotel so I thought it would be stuffy but for some reason it wasn't at all. I think it was the deliciously warm lighting. It was an absolutely lovely surprise evening. This place comes with a serious price tag so you may want to be prepared unlike my friend and I who just happened to wander in and get a table. We went with the four course dinner but I definitely want to go back for the ten course dinner. Anyone want to take me for my birthday? Anyone? Hey you A.H. Yeah you!"
"Cheers to Brittny!! For another awesome Supper Club Event and a huge thanks to M√©lisse for having us, the wonderful dishes and the impeccable service! It was my last Yelp event for 2016 since the holidays are coming, and I wanted to go out with a bang!!

Loads of interesting, unique, and new concepts like:

- A grape coated with goat cheese, coated with pistachio WITH IT'S COUNTER PART: a grape jelly emulsion with a goat cheese center, topped with pistachio... They're basically the same ingredients, but totally different flavors, one was sweet and one was savory. MIND BLOWN!

And that BASIL BRIOCHE was bomb.COM!!! Who's with me?!

And I loved that little Jell-O shot that had a layer of tomato gazpacho... If Chef Citrin had a cookbook I would buy it, just for that, so that I could woo my friends and family to come over for something out of this world.

Their water service was so amazing, I don't think I have drank that much water even in the past 3 days. Lollll....

Thank you! What can I say, everything was downright amazing down to every detail. They dotted every I and crossed every T."
"My BF had made reservation for our anniversary. Upon arrival, we were greeted and seated at a table that had a ""Happy Anniversary"" Sign and two little cute gift boxes. Sorry, no food pics. They had a no Cell Phone and Flash Photography sign and we respected that. I have pics of the items I took home.

We both ordered the 10 course tasting menu: *Note - I do cut my food in little pieces and pair them up with everything on the plate for a bite. My reviews on based on that and not on each item on its own, unless noted.

We had a platter choice of bread, I went with Basil Brioche and Bacon Foccacia. BF chose the Bacon Foccacia and a plain Brioche. Basil Brioche was delicious! I want to make it myself. The Bacon Foccacia was a bit dry and disappointing. I went for seconds on the Basil.
Amuse - started with with a sparkling wild cactus soda? Forgot. Sorry. It was refreshing and bubbly, not too sweet, just right. Then, a goat cheese covered grape on the side of grape jelly filled with grape juice. It was fun =). The jelly burst into a delicious grape juice. Ended with a oyster in a shell with iced something. The oyster was not sweet, actually a little bitter. Blah, not my favorite. I should have just gave it to my bf.

1) Egg Caviar (Soft Poached Egg, Lemon Creme Fraiche, American Caviar) - I'm usually a fan of anything caviar if paired right. The flavor was good but I don't like my eggs runny, I would have to be in the mood for it. This was paired with with a little rectangular puff pastry, very buttery and went well when dipped in the egg. My bf said it was good dipped with bread.
2) Poisson Cru (Caramelized Uni, Toasted Seven Seeds and Radish) - This was served with Yellowtail. It was good, rich but yet light. Everything went well together.
3) Kuri Squash Veloute - Creamy and buttery. At the bottom were pieces of acorn crumbs which tasted like toffee. =)
4) Sunchoke - All the flavors paired together went well together but I'm not a big fan of sunchoke so it was ok for me.
5) Hokkaido Scallop - This course was ok for me. Didn't stand out. Good together but didn't care much for everything that was on the plate.
6) Fish - piece was cooked perfectly, pairing was good, wished it was a bigger piece.
7) 21 Day Aged Liberty Duck - my duck was more rare than I can handle but it had good flavor. I didn't end up finishing the rarer parts. Jameson Farms Lamb, my bf chose this option for this course. I actually like it better than my duck. I'm very picky on the gameness of the lamb but even though this was gamy, I enjoyed it. It was like O wow gamy, but hmmm, this is good.
8) Tomme Rabelais Rodolphe le Meunier - THE BOMB! I loved this course the most. Simple yet delicious. It was a thin crispy crepe with melted cheese (twist on grilled cheese they said) served with a soft date and drizzled with almond honey. The flavors came together wonderfully. YUM! My mouth is watering thinking about it.
9) Chocolate - There were a lot of items on this plate. I just remember then stacked hazelnut chocolate mouse crisp was good and the coffee caramel quenella was good. The panna cotta was not good.
10) Apples - this last course was a futuristic take on dessert. The creativity was amazing. I preferred to finish my meal with rich decadent chocolate in my mouth. So, when they brought this out I was bummed because I wanted to try it but I wanted to leave with chocolate. My bf loved this course. It was refreshing.

After all was said and done, we were presented with a plate of mini desserts. Which consisted of:
Hazelnut macaron - average
Fruit Jelly block - meh
Hard buttery tiny bundt pastry - buttery but a bit too hard
Chocolate chip cookie - average
Chocolate block - average
Raspberry - its just a raspberry

OVERALL - SERVICE WAS GREAT! Food was good. I would come back to try other dishes and other courses but not the 10 course tasting. Once is enough.

LOVE the decor of the place."
Amazing. Loved every bite. Very pricey but a great splurge for a delicious meal.
"Excellent food, great service and good wines. Will go again whenever I visit LA."
i'm a fan of the tasting menu. the food is divine. pretty. it's like eating art.
"4.5 stars!

The meal it's self is pricey but amazing...

Atmosphere 5 stars: the ambiance is elegant yet relaxed.

Food: 4.5 stars....
Yes, if you're a Michelin restaurant, it's expected to be not great, but perfect.... And I did taste perfection from the first course to the last... Especially when the chef makes something that I really dislike, and make it very tasty!!! However, the main course (sea bass) was too salty though very very creative with the hazelnut moose... We absolutely loved the raw oyster soaked in raspberry moose... It was very delicate! The entire time we felt like those judges in iron chef... Definitely worth the special occasion and the money! I will let picture do the talking here...

Parking: 3 stars... The valet parking person is really annoying.... When you charge $8.50 for parking, I expect you to at least break my $20 and wait for me to tip you rather than just keep it and assuming I'm gonna tip you more than the charge of the parking... I get really annoyed when ppl do that....

Service 5 stars: our server took time to explain every dish... Very attentive...."
"I rated 2 stars based on my experience with Melisse on my mom's birthday. It was a bit disappointing.

Melisse is a Michelin 2 star restaurant. What I expected was food with high quality and great taste. However, the oyster appetizer (oyster with pomegranate foam) disappointed me big time. What happened was that I smelled rotten right after the server brought the dish in front of me. I thought the smell might just be my own imagination, so I took a bite.....And I wanted to throw up the next second... I called the server over and told him it's a bad oyster. The server's reply was funny:"" I know.. I can smell it...."" (Lol.. I'm having bad breath and I know that..) He then gave me two choices: either change the oysters or change to another appetizer. I figured I ve had enough with the oysters, so I picked another appetizer instead. The rotten oyster smell and taste pretty much ruined my appetite for the other dishes. :(

Other than that, other food--4 stars, service --4 stars, parking--3 stars (we parked at the meter and walked 10 mins), ambience--3 stars, price--1 star (..lol...overpriced)"
"I'm not a foodie, I just front like one on Yelp. No need for overused food adjectives, cause shit was just good, truth.
One of my favorite meals...also, the longest. I flew into Phoenix but ended up driving 6+ hours here just to sit down and have a 6+ hour meal. My ass wasn't happy, but my palette took precedence.

Go w/ the carte blanche for the full experience. You'll be BMF up in here @ $250/pp, but totally worth it.

Full 15 course excluding the amuse:

http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=Mln71x70ZKNA7EDxtK9EpQ&select=WPbktu3CO9CsPuzvLlQX5w

The only negative I had was on a few courses during the middle of the meal is I don't know if the server was busy but we had to call them over several times to describe the prep and ingredients. Having my amigo say ""Salmon...enjoy."" doesn't exactly prepare my senses.

So:
1. Come early and hungry.
2. Wear something comfortable...hey it's LA. I rolled up in jeans and Chucks. Summer dress w/ room to grow for the ladies.
3. ???
4. PROFIT

Now excuse me while I go back to my fruity pebbles and frozen Costco chicken for the next few months..."
"My wife and I came hear for our 5 year wedding anniversary. This was a VERY special night for us, No kid, dressed up and ready to just enjoy each others company. This was 5 years ago by the way, to this day I still twll all my friends about how AMAZING the experience was and just how D*MN good everyrhing was. I was entertained as well by our law school graduate server who had quit being a lawyer to work at this restaurant because he makes more money than being a lawyer and he gets to surf 5 days a week. What a life right? Lol, Anyways, We celebrated our 10 year anniversary recently and we couldn't think of a better place to go so we went back and it BLRW our minds again. 10 course tasting menu feels like a sucker punch goodness to yer Face! I can't even begin to describe how much I love this place. We've been twice in 5 years and both timea the Executive chef/ Owner came to our table to ask how the meals were and also to just chat. Gotta love him staying food to his clientel even with 2 Michelin stars. I wish I could eat here every night but unfortunately I need to save for 5 years to eat here once so we'll be back for our 15th anniversary FOR SURE! I would recommend this place to ANY & EVERYONE as long as they know what they're walking into... Expensive once in a lifetime culinary experiences! (Well, maybe once every 5 years experiences)"
"We have dined at 2 (Spago and Providence) of the 4 Two Michelin Star restaurants in Los Angeles. People forget that Michelin stars are given on food and nothing else (service, ambiance, etc.). Melisse would easily get 2 michelin stars in all categories if they were ranked. I put them ahead of Providence and Spago easily!

The sommelier, host, server, back waits and chef were awesome! Chef came out to say hi to some tables when he was able to get out of the kitchen. The service was impeccable (perfectly executed proper dinner service), they didn't miss a step (served together, cleared together). Our bread plates were always full, water glasses, wine glasses, and mis en place.

We did the 10 course tasting menu ($150). The portions were perfect and incredible. I do not eat Foie Gras and the server was so accommodating for making a substitution. He never once made me feel bad or uncomfortable for asking. The John Dory was the best we ever had and of course egg and caviar is always so dreamy. Our friend ordered the white truffle (alba) risotto and it was the tastiest risotto I have had. The scent of the truffles was mesmerizing and puts you in a happy place.

They also have a 4 course menu for $115, 4 supplements (all with white truffes) and for 2 menus (small).

The seating is interesting. They have a dining room with multiple tables in the center and then booths half way around. Then a dining room that can be closed off and then a separate dining room away from the main dining room. I would suggest requesting a booth. They are comfortable and roomy. If you are going as a group here it's great they actually have rounds for 5-8 people! I love sitting in circles with big groups because no one is closed off.

They have quite the wine menu and a typical corkage program. We brought a bottle of lafite rothschild and bought a bottle so our corkage was waived. $30/bottle for the first two and then $50/bottle after that.

There are a couple meters on the street that Valet is on, so if you see one take it otherwise valet is $8.50.

They have a very interesting reservation confirmation system. You make the reservations and then you must call within 48 hours to 12 hours of your reservation or they give it away. I think it's a great system.

There is no dress code here which is great. There were men in slacks and jeans and women in dresses and jeans. It makes the experience a lot more comfortable and relaxed.

This place does not disappoint. Every penny was worth it.

If you are looking for a true fine dining experience in Los Angeles this is your place. If I forgot anything and you have questions message me!"
"This may be a little overambitious of me to attempt a critique at arguably one of the best restaurants of its kind, or any kind, as my first yelp review. But nevertheless, I will try my best.

I took my wife there a few days ago for our first Valentine's dinner as a married couple. The woman behind the counter didn't exactly greet us as I would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. A very indifferent check-in and coat check and then we were shuffled along our way to our table. I took a moment to breathe in the surroundings and get settled. Almost immediately, I noticed the little purple stool that so many women on here have gushed over. I half expected my wife to be shivering because of the complaints I've read on here, but she didn't complain once all night.

We were confused as to who was supposed to be serving us in the beginning. Several different men had introduced themselves to us at separate times throughout the evening. One of them had a truly uncanny resemblance to Nico Bellic (http://www.gtainside.com/downloads/download/Nico-Bellic-prev.jpg) He was a bit cold and his European accent made him difficult to understand.

It wasn't until about 25 minutes after sitting down that we were asked if we were ready to order, despite my mildly anxious looks around the room. We had our minds set on the tasting menu, which would have been $105 a person for a 4 course meal. The waiter helped me changed my mind from the Egg Caviar, Poached Egg, Lemon-Chive Cr√®me Fr√¢iche, American Osetra Caviar to the Truffle Egg, which was $85 by itself or a $55 supplement when substituted on the tasting menu.

I couldn't help thinking, ""I've never paid more than $10 for a whole omelet and here I am ordering an $85 EGG?? What did I get myself into??""

The Truffle Egg was absolutely delicious. Was it $85 delicious? I don't know, but it was worth the price of admission to sample it. It was the single most memorable item of the night for me. For what it's worth, my wife had the wild mushroom ravioli, which she didn't seem all that impressed over.

For the second course, she had the Arctic Char while I had the chef's daily fish selection. Both tasty, but none as memorable as an $85 egg. I have to mention that at this point, we were already full. The dinner service is dragged on quite a bit that we already had a chance to stuff ourselves with about 4 separate passes at the bread tray.

She had the Liberty Farms Duck Breast and Confit, Cous Cous, Eringi Mushrooms, Jamon Serrano, Blood Orange for her Entree and I had the Prime Rib Eye and Beef Cheek Ravioli, Heirloom Carrots, Wilted Winter Greens, Bordelaise Sauce. She seemed to want to eat more of what was on my plate than what was on hers. I ended up eating most of her plate. I've seen others praise the Liberty Farms Duck, but I couldn't understand why as I tried my best to swallow.

Her highlight of the evening was the Sorbet / Tapioca item (forget the name of it). I had the Sticky Toffee Pudding.

All and all, a worthy trip for a special occasion out to the west end. I hope my review was helpful for those of you curious about this place. Melisse should have deserved a 5 out of 5, but I'm going to be picky about this first review. There were a few things about the dinner that could have been better (as I mentioned in the review). I will revisit this place in the near future and hopefully be able to upgrade this restaurant to the 5 stars that it deserves.

A caution for those of you with sports cars that are very low to the ground. Exit out the back end of the valet parking lot. It's not worth ruining the bottom lip of your sports car trying to make it out of the front."
"Kesha can describe this restaurant experience the best.... Blah Blah Blah.

I was not very impressed with this place. After reading all the reviews I was expecting something out of this world (especially for the price!). This place is EXTREMELY OVERPRICED for what you get. I'm sure they must have PAID extreme amounts of money to get the rating they have from Michelin.

Arrival:
First off had to wait 45 minutes to get seated. Reservation was at 9:15pm (arrived at 9:05pm) and didn't get seated till 10pm. We were told to wait at the beginning. After 40 minutes the hostess says we should be seated soon. We were not even offered a drink while we waited mind you.. not even water. What kind of experience is that. These hostess need to go to Red Robin for some training. Or take some lessons from The Dining Room staff on how to offer fine dining service. Finally got seated and they had nice a present of birthday truffles ready for us (these were better than the desserts we got.. i wonder if they are made in house?.. probably not).

Amuse Bouche:
The meal started out good with the amuse bouche.. grape and cheese two ways and a very good tuna tar tar and orange gelee (these were the highlight of the meal). We decided to go with the Chef Tasting Menu after finally getting some information from the waiter. The first time he really didn't explain it that good and really fast and then vamoush he is gone. Some type of disappering act. Waited like 15 minutes for him to return. Tip calculator going down by the minute. Finally order our items from the Chefs menu.

Bread:
Got some bread and they were ok but again nothing spectacular and no selection of butters.

1st Course:
The first two dishes came out duo of foie gras which was cooked perfectly and unagi which was good but the flavors were lacking on both dishes. Also, we didn't get a visit from the waiter on these two to describe them and how it is recommend to eat them. The foie gras plate had so many things going on it was so confusing to me (I needed a flowchart).

Second Course:
Next was the John Dory which was again cooked to perfection but the flavors were so bland that there was no WOW excitement. Also, we got the Turbot which to me was way overcooked and the flavors were lacking. Is there a theme? Does French food have no flavor? Not from my experiences. At least this time the waiter described the dishes.

Third Course:
Next onto the meat course. I got the venison and she got the duo of short rib. The venison was cooked perfect for me but the flavors were not inspiring. The short ribs were also cooked to perfection and there was a mustard sauce that was so good (finally some flavor!) This was the best part of the meal.

Dessert:
For dessert we got the apple tart and the sticky toffee pudding. Both were ok but I don't think dessert is a strong point for this place. Is there a strong point for Melisse? I guess the amuse bouche was the strong point for me. Kind of sad to get the wow at the beginning of the meal and then everything goes downhill. Oh yeah remember we waited 45 minutes to get seated. Half way through our dessert there is a big guy standing in the back of the dining room staring our way. Next thing we notice he is at our table. Whisking away our half eaten desserts and asking if we are finished while doing so. Then the check comes shortly after. Wow. Why didn't they do this to the people before us??

Final:
I wonder if the Chef actually gets to see what goes on in the dining room after the food is prepared? The Sommelier didn't look like the friendliest of fellows and I don't even know if he wanted to be there. On a high note the Valet guys were exceptional and they even run to your car. My reccommendation. Let the valets guys run the floor of the restaurant. Maybe they can add some life into this dull environment. I will not be coming back unless someone drags me in there... I will spend my time at the Dining Room or Jiraffe and leave very well satisfied. I would give 2 1/2 stars but it's not an option. My stars are for the food. There is no way I can give 3 or more stars based on the full experience. This place is WAY OVERPRICED and NOT WORTH IT!"
"One of the best, if not, the best restaurant experiences in this city! From the time we walked in, we were treated like royalty. Exquisite menu, service is incomparable. Even the Chef came to our table.

In a city of restaurants that just come and go, this one is strong, and I think, will be around for a long time, and for good reason."
"Hands down this is the best restaurant that I have ever been to. The service is exceptional where servers take time to explain the menus to you without pressuring you to make a quick decision and without that annoying pushing to upsell you to other items. The lobster bolognese is one of the best tasting dishes, so much so that I ended up purchasing a Chef Citrin's cook book (also exceptional). While I want to deduct a star for the lack of a bar, Melisse is simply too amazing for a petty deduction like that. Definitely put Melisse on your list of places to eat; you won't be disappointed."
"The chef at this restaurant decides what you will eat. There is very little choice in the matter. When the waiter brings a course to you, he tells you how the chef would like you to eat each thing. I followed their instructions exactly, and found the entire meal rather unpalatable. For all of this lack of choice and nauseating ""food,"" you will be allowed the privilege of spending way more than you would on any other meal anywhere else. The experience was definitely unique, and the waiter was somewhat entertaining, which is why I'm giving this place two stars. The restroom was also nice."
"I had dinner with my wife last night at Melisse for the second time. We went two years ago and remembered it to be a little better the first time. I think it must have been an off night. Or maybe weekends are just not as good. I'll definately go on a weeknight next time. Had I written a review after my first experience, I would have given 5 stars. But they lost a star my second time.

We opted for the anniversary menu w/ wine pairing ($110 pp). I was actually really full w/ the 4 courses. I think the 2 extra amuse bouche helped. I really have no complains about any of the courses. I thought they were really good. 1st course: Lobster bolognese was very tasty and had lots of black truffle flavor. 2nd: Alaskan halibut was surprisingly fishy which is how I like it. I thought it match pretty well with the curry emulsion. 3rd: Prime Beef Strip Loin was a little chewy but the jus saved the dish. 4th: passion fruit parfait was actually a pretty good size serving.

I think they may have lost the star last night based on a few things. The bacon bread was pretty dry even when you eat it with butter. I remember the first time I went, it was moist and did'nt need butter. I think there were even little chunks of bacon in it. But last night, it just smelled and tasted like bacon with no chunks and dry. Also they ran out of basil role. My wife had one before they ran out. With that said, if I'm paying over $300 for dinner after tax/tip, I want some darn basil role:) This is considered fine dining and this is inexcusable. Luckily, the olive role was very good.

Last thing, the pours last night on the wine pairings were very small. Again, the first time I went the pours were pretty generous. For some reason, the sommelier did not serve our wine, the waiter did. Next time, I think I'll order from the wine list. You can find a pretty good bottle for under $100."
Amazing special occasion eatery. Melisse is In a category all by itself. Must try.
"What a gastronomic experience!

Beautifully presented dishes w/ wondrous flavors by an amazing staff including Josiah Citrin himself! The standout was the sunflower dish that opened up the meal. Visually pretty, very creative and all those lovely textures packed into a single bite. SO GOOD. I'm not always interested in dessert courses but the 4 courses for dessert was so good. Light and refreshing - nothing too heavy and all incredibly enjoyable.

I've been wanting to come here for a while and so glad we did during our weekender. Thanks, Melisse (and to my fiance for always spoiling me)!"
"A 2 start Michellin restaurant! Have super high expectations for this place and the food sure did execute and delivered. I like the whole lil ""speakeasy"" vibe to it. So unassuming from the outside but as soon you ring that doorbell you enter this quaint lil underground restaurant. Melisse had its own private room and I believe adjacent to it is it sister restaurant called Citron. My husband made this reservation for us a while back. Got the 845pm slot which was one of the best 2hour dining experience I've ever had. Sure wasn't a pretty penny and be prepared to splurge. We go the pre fixed with the wine pairing tasting. Probably around $800 or more for the two of us. Don't let the small portions fool you coz we left this place stuffed and very satisfied. Sadly we didn't even have room for our last dessert course and our last 2 dessert wines. Overall such a delightful experience but just would take 1/2 star down because for the ""michellin star"" expectation, service could somewhat be a lil better and bathrooms could be much nicer
Overall would highly recommend especially for special occasions"
"This is my favorite restaurants in L.A. I absolutely loved every item on the menu. I picked the following items from their prix-fix menu and were very pleased:

* Wild Mushroom Soup: Black Truffle Mousse, Almond Cromesquis
* Maine Lobster ""Flavors of Thermidor""
* Prime Rib Eye: Braised Wagyu Beef Cheek, Dijonnaise, White Mushrooms, Red Wine Herb Jus
* Chocolate Souffle with Espresso Cream (special for that day)

What I like most about Melisse is their atmosphere. Yes, this is a Michelin-rated restaurant, but the ambiance here is not snobbish at all. It is actually pretty laid-back, and, get this, child-friendly! They only have one high chair (so claim it early), but the receptionist actually encouraged me to bring my 8-month old when I made the reservation! The restaurant has good acoustics so that the few times my son made some fussy noises during our 3-hour dinner, no one even noticed. When he needed to be changed, the receptionist actually helped my husband with the wet diaper. Isn't that amazing? Love the service here.

Now only if I can convince them to change his poopy diapers too..."
"First time coming to Melisse and it was for restaurant week! This restaurant was one of the best experiences I've ever had in my life. The staff was very professional, polite and exceptional in making sure everything was just the way we wanted it. I enjoyed how they bring everybody's dishes (even though we had 8 people) all at the same time and take away our dishes all at the same time. Even when we had different number of courses in our set, they still brought a complimentary dish so that people don't feel left out while others eat around them. I thought this was a nice touch. They also brought complimentary appetizers and desserts.

In terms of the food, everything we ate that night was simply amazing.

The first appetizer was two different ways of making tomato and goat cheese. One was a tomato jelly with goat cheese in it and another was a half cherry tomato wrapped with goat cheese. Next I tried the Hokkaido Scallop with Smoked Haddock Mousse, Trout Pearls, Celtuce and Sake Lees. The scallops were in a layer below the haddock mousse. After that I had the big eye tuna slices with avocado and truffle-yuzu vinaigrette. It also had a tuna tartare. I enjoyed both tuna pieces a lot. The truffle-yuzu vinaigrette was really good as well.

Next I had the striped bass with cucumber, kohl rabi and sour sea lettuce broth - super delicious, I drank all the broth after I ate this dish. For the main entree we had the flat iron steak with roasted cauliflower, carrots and braised beef. The meat was quite good and it was placed on this puree layer which added a lot of interesting flavour to it.

Finally, for dessert we had the Passion Fruit Souffle with coconut sorbet and lemongrass and tapioca milk. All in all, I don't know what I enjoyed the most because all the dishes were astounding and super delicious. I would definitely love to try this place again."
"It's worth at least one visit, but any subsequent visits depend on who's paying or how much I want to impress my meal mates. But we did have a wonderful dinner, probably one of the best meals from a food perspective I've ever had. I came away so stuffed and satisfied after experiencing their carte blanche menu. And I can eat A LOT! It even carried over to the next morning that I had to haul my ass to the gym (my first time in a month!) to make myself feel a little better about eating so much.

We came on a Saturday night. I called that morning and they could seat our party of 5 at 8:45PM. We had the carte blanche meal which is 12-14 courses spread out over close to 4 hours. They'll tell you it's 3, but really, it's 4. It's just like every other prix fixe meal I've had in that the introductory courses are the best and the heavier meat courses are not nearly as good. I won't delve into what was served since you don't really have a choice, but there were several incredible standouts including original style foie gras and tomato soup with sorbet. I know that soup sounds weird, but it was one of the best things I've ever tasted. Service is as good as you would expect from a prix fixe french restaurant. There is semi-coordinated serving and they always had someone to describe to us what was being served. I say semi-coordinated bc other places that I've been to like Michael Mina and Aqua have truly coordinated serving where they have one server per person to lay down the course at the same time. That is what I think of when I hear coordinated service. Melisse, more or less, but not that level of coordination. We were visited by Josiah Citrin a couple of times. It was just a quick passing, not overly involved, but it was nice to see him make the attempt. The number of staff they employ is an impressive sight. The restaurant isn't large, but there were an endless amount of faces, particularly the number of waiters dressed in suits and ties. However, I didn't feel as though I had enough exposure to develop a rapport with our head waiter since we were being served by several different attendants. The women at our table each got their own stool for their purse. It's nice to have, but I've seen nicer purse stools at lesser restaurants.

You could order a la carte or from their tamer list of 3 course prix fixe meals (yes that's plural - among them a tomato based meal, a veggie meal, and the regular) but there are a lot of restrictions what you can get for the $105 per person price for the prix fixe. Most of the items interesting me came with supplemental fees that increased the cost to $140pp or even more. Because of that, it makes the most value sense to get the carte blanche meal which is $175 per person. The bad thing about that is that you have to make sure you have a whole evening to devote to dinner. If I didn't have that much time, I definitely would not come here as I don't see anything but the carte blanche meal worth ordering. Another small negative, the waiter failed to ask us if any of us had any food allergies or other aversions to mention. Granted, the people affected could have made it a point to remember to mention it, but how often does a customer come across that situation where they have to outlay what they can and cannot eat? For Melisse, it should be a standard question and many other french restaurants I've visited have made a point to ask. We were one of the last two parties at the restaurant at 1AM, but it was nice to come later bc this place can get really noisy. When we were seated at 8:45PM, I remember thinking how the other reviewers were dead on with their description of the noise. I could barely hear what others in our party were saying. Around 10PM it began to empty and it really became a very pleasant environment. At around midnight, it was almost a ghost town like Pacific Dining Car. I would suggest reserving for 8PM. That would allow you to have a good mix of both worlds. Otherwise I'd suggest you request a table in the small room to the right of the entrance bc it's intimate and the noise isn't nearly as bad. There is an impressive looking cheese cart, but it's just OK. Dessert was probably the most unimpressive course. Just not in keeping with the deliciousness that describes the rest of the meal. Oh and the temperature of the room is a bit wacky. During our 4 hours there, the feeling in the room ranged widely from a tad cold for the women/comfortable for the men to a tad warm for the women/too warm for the guys. That was weird. And make sure to not park on the residential only streets! That added $50 to my evening.

Price: About $240 per person for carte blanche prix fixe meal with drinks, tax, and tip.
Food: Fabulous
Service: Very Good (but compared to other top drawer french restaurants, just OK)
Ambiance: OK to Very Good depending on noise
Location: OK but $6.50 valet sucks along with residential only street parking restrictions"
"DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM. Absolutely the worst customer service during a pandemic. I needed to cancel an order as a member of our party was sick. Melisse did not respond to emails, did not call back and has continued to not be responsive. Way to go during a pandemic. Charging people with zero respect or follow through when someone is sick."
"Did the 4 course menu with the wine pairing. The food was delicious! Service: we had a female server who was OK. Not bad and not great. We did the wine pairing and I was NOT impressed by the sommelier at all. He was quite arrogant and seemed rushed and uninterested. Fernando, who I believe was our server's assistant was AMAZING! He wasn't fake and genuinely enjoys what he does and made our experience wonderful. He truly went out of his way to provide incredible service. I hope his manager sees this review and realizes that he is great! Price- very expensive but definitely a memorable meal"
"Wow it has changed from a lighter atmosphere to darker one(the decor is much darker now than years ago.) The service is very prompt and professional but not as warm and friendly and you really don't know who is waiting on you, there are so many people bringing you this and that but it has lost it's friend factor. We got the 7 course with wine pairing....I had gotten it in the past and was excellent!(2004-2007) But times change I guess. It was just too ""Impersonal"" very corporate....Sad too because my memories of this place and the wait staff was laughing and smiling. The food was good but not raving excellent like before, but the wine was too slow between considering the wine sommelier poured just barely a gulp(wine pairing is $150.00 apiece) we had to wait to ask for more wine to pair with the small portion of a course to which it was eaten already! I was very disappointed and at over $800.00!? So we got up to pay and Josiah was in front and saw I was disappointed and he asked why, so I told him the wine pour was small and we had asked for more than just a gulp of wine? He apologized and took off one of our wine pairing fee, which was very nice of him he told us we could have asked for more wine but his staff was not on top of things and they were very snooty when I did ask for more. I had also eaten at his Jirraffe restaurant many years ago which was excellent too. We took an Uber for that reason, but I was sober and my wife looked at me like ""why did you spend this amount of money we just barely had a bottle?"" I had been bragging about this restaurant for years!? Well I guess I'll move on."
"Amazing and everything I'd hoped it to be. The standout dish for me was the White Asparagus ""Cocotte"" and the Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate dessert (three different types of chocolate desserts). The servers were attentive, knowledgeable, and had great recommendations.

My only warning, the food just keeps coming! This is not a light meal."
"Every time....5 stars. The food is beyond words and the service is the best. One of my most memorable moments....On my anniversary dinner with my wife...the place was sold out and during our desert course, the chef came out to congratulate us on our anniversary. Talk about personal attention and top notch service...I will always remember."
"I went there by myself. I didn't feel lonely at all, because the staffs there are so nice. They came and talked to me before each course served. They even let me to visit the kitchen. I met the chef in a kitchen and took a glance of how things work in the kitchen. That was one of the best experience I've had in a Michelin stars restaurant"
"I would actually give 0 stars if i could given the price. I was really excited because it was the first michelan 2 star restaurant I've been to. I thought I would try the venison since I've never had it before, but it was utterly disgusting. I couldn't even swallow it! It wasn't just me. My friend who had venison before, and actually likes it, thought it was pretty gross. The first course lobster penne was pretty good but everything else went downhill. The fish they had for the second course was less than spectacular. So disappointed for one of the most expensive meals I've had in my life."
"I went there for my first time friday night. I didn't call until about noon on Friday for a reservation so the earliest we could get was 9pm...apparently a pretty popular spot despite its price point. Once we got inside it was apparent that this place is small and intimate, a very good thing. I won't go into too much detail but I can say without a doubt that every part of the night was as good as it could possibly be. The food was exquisite, more than living up to its hype. The wine list is as impressive as the food. The wait staff and their interactions with us were perfect. I could not imagine a better staffed restaurant. Everyone was perfectly polite and extremely helpful without pushing us towards one option or another.

Overall I have never had a better dining experience anywhere. Melisse is a place everyone should go to at least once."
"I have not been there lately.....like.... a couple of years. I have recommended this place to lots of people and made sure that I received feedback though. They say food is delicious and consistent, but the quality of service has been significantly lowered as it has gotten more and more recognition. Maybe it is time I checked it out again."
"If you have ever been to Le Bernardin in NY... this is a direct competition!!! The only thing they are lacking is in their decor and seating. Then the food, the service unmeasurable. Worth every penny. And most important they may be expensive but I loved the amount of variations. Well prepared staff.

Thanks Melisse for a great experience."
"My review is for a Pre-pre-Mother's Day Dinner (Friday) courtesy of my husband.

Josiah Citrin, 2 star-Michelin chef-owner behind Melisse in Santa Monica is simply creating exquisite and eventful tasting menu for diners over 25 years. Therefore, as soon as we stepped in we expected nothing but the best from this restaurant.

We arrived 20 minutes before our reservation and we witness an ongoing staff meeting in the main dining area of Melisse. The staff exhibited energy and were all elated to begin their expertise and mastery in presenting myriads of dining and culinary experience for patrons. My husband wanted the 10-course tasting menu but we opted for the 7 course instead since both our meal needs to mirror image of each other. He added the wagyu in lieu of his Boeuf.

Our meal was exquisite, superb presentation and service was excellent."
"We are holidaying in LA for the first time from Australia and wanted to fine at a few really nice/high end restaurants while we are here. Melisse was recommended to me before traveling so we booked and were really excited to try out this 2 Michelin star restaurant.

We arrived 15mins early and the host was a little shocked but organized our table for us within a few minutes.

We sat and were offered the menus and wine list (really nice and extensive)

We chose the 10 course tasting menu.
To make the review brief- the good was good not the best I had on my holiday and not as good as I had expected from this place.
The wines were very nice although it would have been nice if on occasion we didn't need to pour our own.

The waiters/hosts hovered in the dinning room not actually doing much other than having a chat, folding there arms and looking bored. One of the hosts also appeared to possibly be drunk and had to go and sit down a lot behind a curtain near out table.

Our actual waiter was lovely & helpful.

I think melisse was good but could definitely be and expected to be better for the price"
"Came for dinner recently. My entire party of 6 people got the tasting menu. Overall, I would say that while the food here is really well done, if you want a special evening, I would opt to go elsewhere given the service doesn't justify what you will spend here.

The food overall is good. Everything is very well cooked and fresh. Of everything I had, the dessert really stood out. If you get the tasting menu, get the fruit dessert. The chocolate can be skipped. The basil brioche bread was also awesome. Everything else was again cooked and sourced masterfully, but not entirely memorable.

The service, was very memorable and not in a great way. I'm usually not someone to nit pick on service but I think that it's fair to do so when 1) the tasting menu is $$$ and 2) the service is so bad that it actively detracts from the entire experience. Our server forgot what we ordered multiple times (yes, there were 6 people, but when 4 out of 6 order the exact same thing off if a set tasting menu I don't know how much of a test on memory the order still is). That would be excusable, except our server then actively interrupted the entire table's conversation to ask for our order again. Again, that might be excusable, except for the fact that when the food was finally brought out, the wrong dishes were places in front of people. This happened multiple times. I could go on and list the numerous other faux pas -- it honestly got to the point where it was extremely funny. At one point someone came to ask what kind of water we wanted. When our server came a few minutes later asking the same thing, she said ""oh he shouldn't have don't that"" when we told her that someone had already come by to ask. I'm really not sure what was going on behind the scenes at this restaurant, but with all the friction and chaos we saw, they should maybe consider shooting a reality show about the staff.

If there's a particular dish that you like or something you really would like to try that is only offered here -- get it to-go. The food again, is well-done. I would not return to dine-in. I would watch the reality show on the staff though."
"The service is impeccable, the wine list is extensive and amazing, the silver ware and plates all from France. They even steam iron the table cloth. Initially, I was pleased when they delivered a special velvet stool designed to hold my handbag. I ordered the lobster bolognese, fresh cappelini, summer truffles and basil as the 1st course ($27) and the trio of prime beef, fillet, strip loin and short ribs, potato galette, swiss chard and fourme d'ambert gratin, sauce choron as an entry ($43).

This is going be against popular opinion and all the food critics that had their press articles posted on the wall when you first walk in. When the menu states swiss chard, this means one single, short snip of leaf nestled under something as decor, something tiny btw. The wine glasses are huge and the wine is poured perfectly. Imho, the food is all about the sauces which is good. And the impeccable presentation with the warmed plates and the food is at perfect tasting temperature. A host comes by after the waiters put the plates down to announce each of the morsels.

Delivered with such fanfare, comp is the appetizer for two. What's this? A rare bird egg? The chef and my date was lucky that I didn't giggle when I realized that it is SINGLE grape, halved into two and molded with goat cheese around it to resemble a miniature quail egg. Wha? Ok, are you kidding me? This is just the beginning of what felt to be an inside joke. We are then presented with a green chilled cucumber concoction topped by a layer of a red tomato puree in what resembles a tall shot glass, which we were instructed to sip. Frankly, what's the big deal? This is pureed tomato and cucumbers.

My lobster cappelini, delivered in a huge beautiful white plate - with what looked and tasted exactly like half a package with well cooked instant ramen noodles. The cappelini I've always had is fine and thin, the pasta here was soft, and flat EXACTLY like ramen noodles. The sauce was amazing, I spooned it up carefully cause gee whiz, the meal is quite pricey. I know, I know - it's not about the portions it's about tasting the bits of food. But my 1 1/2"" x 1 1/2"" cube of short beef rib was charred to a black crisp on the outside and was well done. I ordered medium rare. I cut away the burnt crisp sides. The waiter didn't comment when he removed my white plate with the tar-black, cancerous bits all over it.

The table next to me had the same thing and it was blackened as well. Definitely not amazing as described earlier by other postings. I got the two highly recommended dishes and no, it didn't do it for me. The other types of beef were medium rare as I had ordered, not memorable. On my plate also is a rectangular shape of what tasted exactly like a tater tot, a sweet thin wafer cone injected with mashed potato slipped into a tiny shot glass, a curve of carrot puree and a small scoop of a green something or another. It is served with about a cup of creamy mashed potatoes in a separate silver bowl.

My date ordered the duck and it looked and tasted exactly like my beef. It's not just me, he also said it tasted just like beef. Two glasses of pinoir noir, no dessert. Typically in this type of place, there should be a 1st course, a 2nd course and an entree. However, we had go over to a music venue, and all this show took a really long time. And frankly I didn't want to order anymore of the carefully arranged morsels of food. It is just a few bites that you absolutely must appreciate, for no other reason than the extreme prices. After the wine settled a bit it was yummy. The wait staff mostly hover around the main table, under the crystal chandelier. Everything was completely boneless. The waiters will debone your fish at your table.

The desserts I saw looked beautiful, with a presentation similar to Chaya. The crowd was on the older side. It isn't a stuffy atmosphere, the staff is friendly and polite. Go if you want to slowly savor a 3 hour meal tasting bits of of food, are in the mood to spend $300 per person and you truly appreciate the impeccable presentation, the beautiful dishes and delicately balanced silverware which comes at a high price. Valet parking $4.50. If you have to go elsewhere in the area, the lot is not gated and they will return your keys and let you leave your car there when you ask. My date continued to insist that he was pleased and will be going back in a couple of weeks with some foodies to experience it properly in all it's glory, whatevers. Sorry, I'm kind but I can't be ridiculous.

6-20-07 Update

Downgraded from three to two stars, due to the atrocious, minuscule portions, very average, way over-priced, and annoying frothy bits of food."
"Came here to try out my first starred restaurant (even though the guide has left LA). Left feeling like I'd had an amazing meal but I feel like it fell greatly short of expectations and the price I paid.

First off, a disclaimer: I came here March 2016 and had the 10 course tasting menu. This menu changes seasonally every couple of weeks depending on ingredients available. If you go here now, only a few of the items that I had will still be on the tasting the menu. The rest will be completely new dishes.


Decor: 5/5

The outside of the restaurant is rather unassuming, the windows are blocked out with white paper or cloth of some kind so you cannot see the inside of the restaurant. The inside of the restaurant is broken down into 3 sections: table seating, booth seating and a private room for larger parties. The tables are covered in white tablecloths and a glass centerpiece is placed on each table. There are no pieces of fancy artwork or creative furniture to distract you from what you should be concentrating on: the food (which is art in and of itself)

Service: 5/5

The service here is pretty much the gold standard for any fine dining establishment. The wait staff is extremely knowledgeable about each item on the menu: from the ingredients, to the preparation, to the proper way to eat each dish. If you are not dining alone, you'll notice that each item is served at exactly the same time by 2+ separate waiters so that everyone gets their dish at exactly the same time. You will also notice that your water glass will never go empty as the wait staff pay careful attention to you during your meal and will be there refilling your water whenever you're close to running out. The only issue I noticed during the service was that the new utensils brought out for each course were quite noticeably unevenly spaced between my partner and I (not an issue in the slightest at any other restaurant but at a Michelin Starred restaurant this is slightly inconsistent with the idea of ""perfect service"").

The Food: 3/5

Before I start this section, one caveat: the food here is quite good. Were I to get this kind of food at any other restaurant at a different price point and different level of prestige I would easily give it 5 stars.

The meal began with 2 ""grapes"": one real one wrapped in goats cheese and cashews (incredible flavor combination) and one ""grape"" which was actually a spherified liquid. They looked identical to the eye but each had a different and very unique flavor. Excellent.

After this was a citrus soda to ""awaken the palate"" to quote the waiter. Bright, flavorful and delicious, it is the standard I will judge all other sodas by.

After these initial appetizers, I was prepared for a tasting menu that would easily be the best eating experience of my life. Unfortunately this was not the case.

The first course was an Uni dish served with some type of gel. It was pretty good, but rather confusing for a first course.

The second was Melisse's famous Egg Caviar. This, as I'm sure all the other reviews will confirm, is amazing. The richness of the egg yolk combined with the decadence of lemon creme fraiche and slight saltiness of the caviar is a flavor unlike any other. The richness of the dish is lightened by the chives on top and complimented by a buttery puff pastry that is served alongside it.

The next several courses consisted of Foie Gras, Fish and Beef as well as a black truffle ravioli.

None of these courses impressed in the slightest. The Foie was served alone with a cranberry jam and was good but certainly wasn't creative or particularly flavorful. The fish was perfectly cooked but I found myself enjoying the flavor of the vegetables underneath much more. The ravioli was pretty much ruined by the egg placed on top which overwhelmed the subtle flavors of the truffle and the ravioli itself.

My issue came during the beef course, which consisted of a Ravioli, a piece of ribeye cap and a pastry/cake of some kind. The beef ravioli, however, was undercooked. I could tell instantly from the first bite of it which tasted of raw dough and a cool beef mixture.

How this kind of thing slips past the Chef is beyond me. After alerting the staff to this issue, it's worth noting that they didn't replace the item but simply took 25% off the bill.

The other courses were also not notable.

Dessert came in the form of a Nutella cake with chocolate balls and ice cream. It skirted the line between too rich and bland perfectly and ended up on the side of the absolute limit of taste without crossing the line. Excellent.

The final ""course"" came in the form of several small pastries including a canele which is ""the true test of a french pastry chef"" according to the waiter. It wasn't very good.

To sum up why I gave Melisse 3 stars: Fine dining restaurants should be judged on food first. I came here expecting brilliance but, with the exception of a few dishes, was underwhelmed."
This place is nuts. Soooo much food. Great desserts and the cheese offering is a must!
"Easily the best restaurant in LA! From service, ambiance - to food... Be ready to drop a G for 2, but so worth it! If you're looking for a classy restaurant with excellent service and food made by the best chefs - Melisse is it! I went there for my bday. The staff really made the whole experience so special. They definitely know how to art!"
"We came here for our anniversary and though the restaurant is at Michelin standards, Im not completely convinced it was worth it.

The food was good but not worth remembering nor going back to or possibly my palette is not as refined?

Each course was presented very beautifully though I do think the interior needs an update. Its a bit drab."
"The BEST anniversary ever!!!

The most amazing food I've ever had of all the tasting menus we've had - the most consistently great! It's no wonder this place has 2 Michelin stars! It's absolutely well deserved and its some place you should experience at least once!

The decor is very modern with a purple twist! The service is impeccable and what you expect from a restaurant of this caliber!

Upon being seated - there is a little stool for my purse! Hooray! What a nice touch!

Anyway, we went with the 10 course dinner (which is really more like 15 courses and took about 3.5 hours!) A veritable culinary Disneyland! And of course, each dish is a work of art!

Amuse - grapes two ways. One cut and covered with goat cheese and pistachios - another a gastronomic grape! Both interesting and delicious!

Also, they bring you a little glass of a carbonated citrus drink - to cleanse your palate - which may be one of the best things I've ever drank! Sweet but fresh! Amazing but so simple! A great start!

Oysters - I guess the ""real"" amuse - served in a little tin - so adorable! The oysters were tasty - again I'm not a huge seafood person - but they were delicious and the presentation was just so whimsical and beautiful! The trout caviar added a nice saltiness without a fishy taste but there was also a bit of a saltwater/briny gelee! Overall a beautiful and tasty dish!

Egg Caviar - a soft poached egg with a lemony creme fraiche and some caviar on top! I'm not a huge fan of caviar but this was delicious! Added a nice salt and no fishy taste or smell! Delicious! Also, the flaky pastry that accompanied went perfectly with the egg! Yum!

Fois Gras Torchon - this definitely changed the way I think about fois gras! This was superior quality and although I'm not a huge fan of forced meats, I could definitely eat half. I thought the portion was large - and it's extremely rich - although well balanced with the mandarinquat marmalade underneath! But still half went to Pump! It's a very rich dish!

Artichoke Soup - The crumbsky! I thought the word was adorable and I love a good soup! This soup was delicious! Very earthy and I loved the strong cheese flavor on the croquette! Adorable and delicious!

Romanesco Cauliflower - this was definitely one of my favorite dishes - I loved the intense Asian fermented black bean flavor - and it was just so umami! Delicious!

Scallop Dish - that scallop was melt in your mouth perfect! I actually wished for more! And I loved that salsify pur√©e! It was out of this world! I was scraping it off the plate as Pumpie happily watched me happily enjoying it! :) I love salsify! It's my new favorite obsession! Also, those blood orange pieces! How do they peel them so well! I must know!

Fish (Cod) dish - I'm not a fish eater - in fact I never eat it - aside from shellfish - because I'm just not a filet fan! But... I really enjoyed this dish! The sauce was almost like a broth and the fish was perfectly flaky and almost potato-y! Ahhh! It was a delicious dish and the broth was so tasty! Mushroomy!

Beef Dish - we had the prime beef rib eye cap med rare! Absolutely delicious! With just salt and pepper that meat was delicious and super high quality! No fattiness! The balance of the fat/richness of the beef and portobello mushroom was a nice contrast to the bitterness of the raddichio and stinging nettle pur√©e! Another home run!

Cheese Dish - this was a caramelized cheese with a bit of black pepper honey and a bacon mousse! Light but tasty and the date was delicious!

Chocolate Dish - Sophisticated was the first thing that came to mind - but still somehow decadent and chocolate-y! A win! And just so beautiful to look at too! And still quite sweet!

Fruit Dessert Dish - my favorite of the dessert dishes - a bit of cherimoya fruit with a tangy and light tangerine sorbet and with little tapioca pearls and tiny perfectly peeled pieces of tangerine! Light but the perfect balance of sweet! So delicious!

Tea course - they brought out a little glass of Melisse or lemon balm tea! Actually very delicious and went perfectly with the meal end!

Cookie course - another assortment of cookies! Ahhh! I was stuffed but everything was just so tasty! Canales, macarons, bon bons, and a jelly candy. All amazingly tasty! The tamarind macarons were definitely my favorite! A lovely tang to balance the sweetness!

Everything was just amazing! I not only left stuffed but having broadened my culinary horizons and having eaten and loved some items that I would never have ordered elsewhere!

Of all the tasting menus that I've had, this one has to be my favorite! Every single thing was amazingly and meticulously prepared and executed - which made all the dishes absolutely delicious!

On a side note - the chef's son was eating at a table with his friends in front of us and we got to see the cheese table/cart! It's huge and full of delicious looking cheeses - and cheese accoutrements! Yum!"
"The much anticipated trip to Melisse ended in disappointment. Although 2 stars is a rough review, I think it's a fair one.

Service: 3 stars - I liked the service, but there were some little things I noticed.
Atmosphere: 1.5 stars - Entrance area including VIP room and hallway to restrooms
4.5 stars - Main Dining area
Food: 1.5 stars - I'm judging very, very strictly because it is Melisse

I arrived early and was greeted by two lovely girls (Ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel). The entrance of the restaurant was less than appealing. They were setting up the VIP room for a party right by the entrance. While I entered, I glanced into the VIP room and thought it was a messy storage space. Chairs, towels... everything was everywhere. Please have your room set up prior to any guests' arrival.

Then, I was asked to sit in the 'waiting area' to wait for the rest of my party to arrive. I was anticipating a real waiting area. Instead, there were four chairs facing the wall right next to the entry door... I sat there awkwardly for about ten minutes, facing nothing but the wall (Good thing there was a book there). As other guests came in for their dinner reservations, the entry area very quickly became very crowded. It was not very pleasant.

My party arrived and we were taken to our table. Our coats were checked professionally. I did not feel like I was at a restaurant that is Melisse until I had left the entry area into the main dining room. The dining area was upscale, grand, simple, and elegant. We were seated in a booth, overseeing the whole dining room.

We waited a while for our main waiter to come. At one point, I mumbled ""where's our waiter?"" I think he heard me... but owell... I liked our main waiter. I would've liked it more if... 1) he didn't talk so loud. 2) didn't move so quickly as if he was in a rush. 3) had shoes that matched his suit. He was also a little too casual for the type of restaurant. But other than that, I enjoyed him. He was sincere, and not full of shxt like some of the other waiters I've seen at upscale restaurants. (ahem, Providence)

The Food - I usually don't like set menus. I like a la carte. I know what I like, and I like to order what I like to eat. But in this case, I ordered the Dine LA menu. In addition, I ordered a Lobster Bolognese a la carte.

Bread - Decent. Very greasy but lacks flavor. I had the bacon and basil. Providence had better bread.

Oyster with pomegranate - Oyster itself was okay. The pomegranate bubbles and whatnot was more for show than for flavor. Honestly, I've had better oysters for way cheaper at a hole in the wall in SF.

Beef Tartar - The plate itself looked very extravagant. There were a lot of different components to the dish and it gives a wonderful texture. Creamy, crunchy, chewy, and tender. The problem was with the taste. The taste of this dish was disappointing. The flavor of the citrus and rice crispy overpowered basically everything else(personally, i don't like citrus in my food and i hate rice crispies). The other components of the dish only added to the greasy texture, but no flavor whatsoever. I had no idea it was beef i was tasting.

Cod - The cod was probably the best dish of the night, but it's not to say it WOWed me. The cod was perfectly cooked (even a little on the rare side, depending on your preference). The broth was very typically french - nothing special here. The mushrooms sitting under the fish in the broth was pretty good as well. Again though, there was a overpowering citrus flavor (this time, someone else noted it).

Beef Short Ribs - This dish came and immediately it smelled BBQ. This smell triggered something in my brain that brought me to the times when I was licking pungent BBQ sauce off my fingers after eating a plate of ribs. (not the kind of association you want to have at a restaurant like Melisse). The dish itself was okay. The other ingredients tasted better than the short ribs... (mushrooms, puree, vegetables)

Quail - ahh, the quail... There really isn't much to say here.. No texture, no taste, even the aesthetics of the plating were not appetizing

Lobster Bolognese - Sauce to pasta ratio too high. Minimal Lobster. Sauce too salty and a little too heavy on the herbs. The pasta had no texture. Way passed al dente...

Service - Servers were friendly and professional. Personally, I think it was a little messy having so many servers running around all the time. Some of the servers talked too quickly, didn't have eye contact when describing the dish, had random weird body movements when talking to guests, and were moving too quickly for a restaurant like this.

For the main course, I was annoyed by the messy silverware placed on our table. Also, for our dessert round, the silverware was just confusingly placed... For me, spoon on the left, fork on top. For someone else, fork on the left and spoon on top.. you get the idea.

Overall, the meal was enjoyable, but the food was disappointing."
"I love Melisse! It's one of my fav restaurants in LA but its getting a little old... Dishes haven't changed a whole lot... I hate the fact that there's a supplemental chg for everything... Just up the $ and include more items. amuse bouche hasn't changed... Service was impeccable as always... Overall, a 4, but wish I could have given it a 5."
"I have some mixed feelings here. The amuse was very good. The bread was very good (there was a crazy basil bread, a tasty bacon bread) and the appetizers that we had were amazing. The lobster bolognese was sooooo good. I wanted to eat only that -- I wished I could have had a giant bowl of it. Most of us had the truffle crusted dover sole. It didn't taste very truffley. It was good. Not amazing. Hubby got the duo short ribs. They were odd. The best part was the potato short rib tower. I'd like to come back for the tasting menu. 4 courses for 110 isn't that bad considering the prices a la cart."
"Just like most french restaurants, it's a prix-fixe menu, which usually makes for an interesting dining experience. The ambiance is nice, and the wait-staff is relatively well trained and personable. The food itself attempted to be creative, but was truly forgettable.

I think this restaurant is nice if:

1.You're trying to show off

2. You are truly just looking to have a 10 course meal in a nice atmosphere and have nothing else better to do for the next 2.5 hours and are willing to pay $200/hr. for it.

3. You hold a firm conviction that the more you pay for something, the better it must be (what I believe to be their target audience)

If you don't fall into any of those 3 categories, then this probably isn't the place for you.

In conclusion; nice atmosphere, cool concept, forgettable food.
So if you're a big ""foodie"" not the place for you."
"Wow. I've never been so excited to write a review before. I don't think I have ever had a better dining experience in California. Here's what really stood out to me:

1. The d√©cor is simplistically elegant. Hats off to their design team.

2. The food is not only delicious (and worth every calorie), but the presentation is also jaw-dropping. I am not particularly keen on photographing my food, but I made an exception and actually took a picture of every course because it was just so beautifully presented.

3. The chef comes out and explains each dish. This isn't necessarily unique, but it is still a nice touch.

4. They have a really nice vegetarian menu and it is just as delicious and well-presented as the non-vegetarian one.

5. I really cannot forget to mention that they provide you with a mini chair for your purse. This is pure genius!

:)"
"Food - 4 stars however, sadly,

Staff/Service/Professionalism/ - 2 stars - considering the price of the meal and their Michelin 2 Star status, 0 star! The 6 employees, I interacted and observed were under-qualified or simply didn't care to provide the caliber of service to match their food and Michelin 2 Stars status. Serving/ Waiting Staff at a restaurant of this caliber should do their job with professionalism and accuracy.

Our Ten course Prefix Menu with Wine Pairing felt like a madly rushed race with the consecutive course and wine arriving while we were not even half way through the prior one with th serving staff repeatedly bumping into us and spilling the wine as they poured. This kind of service at a Michelin 2 stars restaurant ? Because plates and wines were rushed and the server was insensitive to our consumption rate, each person often had 3 wine glasses and the plates were literally rushed away while eating them, just so that they could deliver the following one.

One of us at the table asked for a cup of warm water & the restaurant charged us $3.50 for it.
Hmmm, When paying, $175 for the Ten & $165 for the Wine Paring = Total of $340 per person, you would think Melisse could offers us a cup of warm water for FOC... Guess not!

Finally and unfortunately, it was negative enough of an experience for me and so I am reluctant to return."
"The food is truly superb, but the prices are truly exorbitant. Everything on the prix-fixe menu was a bit surprising in its presentation, and utterly delicious. Has an old school service vibe which feels like a treat. Worth the splurge for a special occasion, but only if you're able to take a second mortgage out on your house to pay for it..."
"With a rapidly expanding and experimental restaurant market like Los Angeles, it is difficult for older restaurants to maintain their vision while attracting the new generation.

Melisse does so with a solid menu while staying grounded with a classic ambience. I hope to see Melisse thrive beyond the 14th years it has been serving Los Angeles."
"This is my once-a-year spurge for my husband and I. We went here for our 3-year anniversary and absolutely loved it. We chose the vegetarian tasting menu - which had more food that my zipper could handle - but well worth it. We also chose the wine pairings, which was a lot of wine for me, but husband didn't seem to mind finishing my leftovers. This place is really pricey, but well worth it. The staff is also really nice and friendly - and to me, everyone seemed to be treated the same whether you were dressed in a suit and tie or jeans and sweater. My favorite restaurant in Santa Monica by far."
"So I died, and went to Melisse aka Heaven. Aside from the sublime meal, Melisse is dedicated to showing you it's all about the experience. From the moment you enter, it's rather formal, but all in the name of showcasing superb etiquette and stellar service. I have to say our main server was absolutely adorable, knowledgeable, and all-around good at what he does. These aren't fly-by-night actors or musicians-cum-waiters, they are truly skilled labor.

Of course the dining room is gorgeous with the cushioned banquettes, and lush purple walls, but you all want to know about the meal!

It was my first time, but I delved into the tasting menu, which I HIGHLY recommend. However, a caveat don't eat all day prior to coming here because the richness and decadence of each selection makes it that much harder to move on to the next course. I started feeling delirious by the Maine diver scallops.

Without further adieu, you are first given a pre-amuse-bouche, whatever the name is for that. We had a pistachio-encrusted red grape, which was ethereal. I was hooked. Then we had the real amuse-bouche - a blended and savory corn sauce rounded out with fennel flan and creme fraiche, with a light piece of white fish with orange atop and a crispy caper 9love capers!).

Next, I chose the lobster bolognese - which is a meal in itself. I was pretty much full at this point, but the flavors were so fresh and the noodles, surprisingly more than the lobster, knocked my Gucci shoes off! I have never been so privileged to taste such fresh pasta - even spending a lot of time in Italy, Melisse outdid themselves.

I moved on to the diver scallops, which were divine. They were seared to absolute perfection. One of the accompaniments was sea urchin, which I faced with trepidation. Alas, I took the plunge and it was a gorgeous marriage of flavors.

Finally, for my entree I chose the lamb. Insert salivation. I adored the lamb chop of course and the pistachio crust atop, but the real show stopper was the impeccable sausage. This will forever imbue a feel-good memory in my mind.

Just when I couldn't fit anymore in, I got the Chocolate, Chocolate, Chocolate, which actually tack on one more chocolate because you get four treats! The Souffle was SIMPLY STUNNING. I loved the little tongue-in-cheek syringe with chocolate inserted into the piping hot souffle. I thought Melisse did a great job of almost making fun of themselves here - since it caters to such a high end crowd and it's at the pinnacle of fine dining, the last thing one would expect is a syringe on your plate (sans needle of course). It was good fun. However, I would KILL for that souffle. Like what would you do for a Klondike bar, except insert Melisse's souffle, oh you don't want to know.

The wine was also amazing, and the server picked out his recommendation. I seriously don't recall what I even order, just some fantastic white wine.

One of the only downfalls about this place is you are so full after you leave, and the heavy hand of butter and cream can be hard on sensitive stomaches. With that admonishment, prepare yourself for a truly rich meal, but you will enjoy every moment."
"Amanda N's write-up on 3-11-16 hit the nail on the head except I drop the rating to 2 stars with a touch of generosity at that. In Los Angeles, Providence is light years ahead of Melisse in so many ways....reception, ambiance, attitude, food quality, wine service, et al.
RECEPTION: you expect a warm welcome at a place like this and not from a hostess who must have been told not to return the next day for a casting call....grumpy, cold, disinterested, actually she didn't even say 'hello' but simply when she heard my name she said the rest of my party was already here and turned and walked to the table where she plopped down our menus. And then we waited.
THE START: we waited 10 minutes before anyone came over to inquire whether we would like to start with wine or cocktails. And then to find out later at the end of the evening that the champagne that was poured was $35 a glass.
THE INTRODUCTION: Usually at a place like this the wait staff is friendly and wanting to help you through a rather complicated menu in this case. Not so here. It was almost wham...bam...thank you. No warmth; no friendly ""can I assist you in understanding the menu and options"". Nope, not here. Someone needs to go to a real Michelin starred restaurant and see how real professionals work.
THE ATMOSPHERE AND SURROUNDINGS: let me simply say it is not overwhelming. D√©cor was done by someone who you would never want to ask for their name. Multiple tables of foreign tourists so busy with their Smartphone cameras that I wonder if they even knew what they were eating. It costs $145 so we much photo it. Oh.....and a comment about the wait staff. Where is the wait staff when food items are to be served...who knows. It is the Four Amigo Hombres who do the serving and who then in broken Mexicalish attempt to tell you what is on the plate. Sad. The fellow in the suit who took the orders is over against the wall talking to another one in a suit who also takes the orders.
OK.......BIG BUILD-UP, WITH TRUMPETS SOUNDING, FOR THE FOOD: Not sure where everyone's taste buds are in some of these reviews but foie gras with a $10 supplement on a $145 fixed price is nickel and dimeing the customer.....wouldn't have been bad except my piece of the foie gras had slimmy fat constituting about 25% of the piece on the plate.....and it was mushy underdone. Another at the table had the Wagyu beef tartare spread so thin on the plate like a pancake with tomato emulsion (which took over the plate) -- not very appetizing looking and as there were no comments as it must have tasted unappetizing as well. OK - on to the lobster Bolognese......all froth and no glory...where was the lobster is all I have to say; and no Italian would have ever cooked such a blah capellini pasta. And then I opted for my main to do a drop down from the second course and had the Dover sole with mussels. Overdone dry fish should never arrive at the table at a place like this...but it did....and the mussels? The cook had taken one mussel and probably cut it into fourths....but only 2/4ths were on my plate. Another person at the table had the duck entr√©e.....Liberty duck perhaps but it would have been far better if the chef had taken the liberty to cut out the huge piece of cartilage or connective tissue before cooking.
THE FINALE: dessert chosen by everyone at the table was the tangerine souffl√© with vanilla ice cream. Oh how we all looked forward to that. But what arrived was a souffl√© that caused us all to say ""what tangerine flavor""....or was it the two tiny segments of tangerine that the Four Amigo Hombres put on the top. Didn't matter as the ice cream covered it all. One who advertises as a two star Michelin restaurant should certainly not serve a ""soupy"" souffl√© that had so much sugar and sweetener in it that after one spoonful we all agreed it was inedible. A proper souffl√© is puffy and airy and flavorful.....except that's not the way it was done here. Too bad.
THE END: I haven't even mentioned the wine list. So vastly overpriced one has to wonder how much they really sell (unless it is to those foreign tourists with their cameras who take a picture of the label).......I wonder how long that bottle of Romanee Conti for $23,000 has been sitting in the cellar, or the Harlan cab for $3,450.
GRAND FINALE: that 3% add-on for employee health costs. That's an arguable issue, but then to add 9.5% sales tax to it, and present the tab with a total figure expecting people to be stupid enough to tip on that total....well I guess there is a sucker born every once in a while who is only concerned about going back home and telling people he ate at a faux Michelin two star restaurant. Le Bernardin, Eleven Madison Park, The French Laundry, Daniel are Michelin starred restaurants.
P.S. Valet parking......$8.50. Seems reasonable. What wasn't reasonable was when I gave the attendant a $20 bill and waited for change, his look could have stopped a freight train."
"Bring your wallet!!!!
Exceptional service.
I really like how their tasting menu is set up so it does not take 4 hours for dinner.
I love how the cheese plate optional. I like cheese but can be overwhelming sometime. Hint hint providence.
The lobster pasta is a must.
Don't bother with any other deserts besides the chocolate chocolate chocolate."
"If you are really into food and you don't mind a big check at the end of the night, Melisse delivers. Excellent service, food is superb, room is beautiful. My wife and I dined here with another couple who had lived in Europe for a long time and we were all impressed. A few random comments.

The sommelier (I wish I had remembered his name) was great. I got a little confused about something pretty simple and he straightened me out without making me feel like an idiot.

Much less stuffy than any other 2-star restaurant we had ever been to. The decor was nice but not overdone.

Get the cheese course. I got it instead of desert but you can do both. Really nice presentation and selection.

The attention to detail in the dishes it what you are paying for. For instance I got a duck course. The duck was beautiful and perfectly seasoned and cooked, but the multiple sauces etc. that really took it to another level.

This restaurant is expensive - if you are wanting to compare it to other restaurants in terms of value you'll likely be disappointed. It's an ""if you have to ask you can't afford it"" type place."
"Melisse is it for dinning in Los Angeles. I caveat that I haven't had the pleasure of dinning at Providence, regardless Melisse has been the best dining experience I've had since traveling in San Sebastian, Spain. The quality of ingredients, combinations of flavor, and presentation exceeded all my expectations, even considering its two Michelin Star rating. I have to guess the only reasons Melisse hasn't received a third star is due to its service. While very nice and attentive I think the staff lacked a certain spark that may be found elsewhere, although certainly not in Los Angeles.

The food however, was absolutely divine. While the tasting menu presented a number of different choices for a fair price ($125 I think?) I would like to come back and focus of a few things I found absolutely amazing, particularly the sweet corn ravioli (only seasonal). The lamb was also especially impressive (served three ways). For a special occasion or just simply to treat your tongue to the best LA has to offer, fork up the extra dough and make your way to Melisse. Dress to match the food, nice but not overdone."
"Amazing!

The wife and I came to Melisse for our wedding anniversary. While I expected Melisse to be top-notch in terms of food and service, I didn't expect it to be as awesome as it was!

We had the ten course tasting menu and we loved every bit of it! From the grape appetizer to the egg caviar, to the last bite of molten lava cake, we were amazed. Every bite was not only delicious, but curious and different from anything we've ever had! And if you're a hungry fellow like me, you'll be pleasantly surprised to know that you'll leave Melisse stuffed!

It was the service though, that put Melisse in our top three restaurants though. From the sommelier Brian who helped us select our wine (and gave us a few impromptu lessons on how to handle wine at home) to the waitstaff that made sure to wish us a happy anniversary, the entire experience was well thought out and executed.

Other reviewers have said that the waitstaff is haughty, but I don't think so. They were downright professional, discreet, and even friendly! We cracked a few jokes and they genuinely seemed to enjoy their jobs as professions, and not gigs to pay the bills. When we finished our wine and I forgot to take note of the vineyard and the vintage, I asked to see the bottle again. They didn't bring me back the bottle- they carefully peeled off the label and presented it to me, affixed to a sheet of cardstock. Wow!

My only minor quibble was that the timing of a few of the courses was slightly off, but I won't complain- we're only human :)

So, if you're prepared to shell out some cash for a special occasion, go to Melisse. You'll be amazed!"
"Overpriced and not worth your hard earned $$$$. Was there for a birthday dinner because a friend highly recommended it and I love French cuisine. Their food is not terrible but nothing really stood out, certainly not worth $200 per person. Food was generally on the salty side. I expected a lot more for that kind of money. Would not return here."
"one of the best restaurants i have been to. the only restaurants i had liked better were the thomas keller ones, but not by much. that should say volumes as the keller ones have been consistently in the top 20 in the world.

great service, not pretentious and without a doubt the best i have had in southern california. the experience was fantastic from beginning to end, my favorite dish was what i call the truffle ball soup, even though it was black truffle, it was great. i drool every time i think about it.

ok, so not everything was great... the steak wasn't great and the black truffle supplement on the pasta wasn't pungent enough but at the mere mention of it, the server took the supplement off the bill without anyone asking or even hinting at it.

great experience and they truly earned their stars and the right to be the best restaurant in LA."
"I've been to M√©lisse a few times before with my family around spring time and enjoyed the experience. However the last time I went was a different story. I went with my boyfriend on January 4th 2018, we both got food poisoning. I wasn't entirely sure what dish it was, either the crab sea urchin appetizer or the scallops. I spent the entire night in the bathroom getting sick. I went to the doctor the next day because I still wasn't feeling well, he ran a few tests and concluded that it was salmonella poisoning (which is caused from under cooked seafood). I called the restaurant and told them that we weren't feeling well from the food. They said that they'd run an investigation and call me back. They called back saying that no one else had gotten sick that night, like it wasn't their fault. It doesn't matter if we were the only 2 who got sick, with a doctors note there should be no need for an investigation. We were both returning and loyal customers, and should have been accommodated for our unpleasant experience. Needless to say, we will not be returning to M√©lisse and neither will our families."
"[For the full set of pictures, see the link to my blog on my profile.]

Every so often a dish--and its concomitant sauce--will have a conversation-halting quality to it. On this occasion it was roasted chicken with a viscous and glossy sauce Albufera that implored you to coat each element on the plate in its ambrosial pincers (as for some of the actual pincers served, in the form of Maryland soft shell crab, they, too, were delicious).

During this most recent dinner, it was indeed the sauces that astonished. In addition to the aforementioned Albufera, there was a porcini velout√© finished tableside with a mushroom consomm√©. Was it thick? Was it thin? It was both, making for an immensely satisfying bowl of soup. Then there was a frothy indulgence of nasturtium-crab bisque that flirted with the fried soft-shell crab. Tableside pours even permeated dessert with a strawberry water completing a palate-cleansing final dessert. Much to my delight, Melisse has halted its chocolate pandering--an over-the-top quartet of chocolate that I always found to be too heavy a note on which to end--replacing it with smaller, lighter offerings.

And I would be derelict if I didn't mention the front-of-house, which manages to conduct a seminar on leisure each time we visit, making a great meal move slow like molasses (hmmm, never thought I'd paraphrase RZA): Danica, a new addition to the team, happily pours bottles of wine as if topping off a water glass; Brian, the Gregory House look-alike of a sommelier, ambles over to talk about what he hopes will be a show on the Sundance Channel (""Jackass meets No Reservations,"" he says); James, the indefatigable and newly minted maitre d', exudes an infectious enthusiasm that keeps us coming back; and all of this happens while Chef de Cuisine Ken Takayama in zen-like quietude runs the kitchen.

Which isn't to say there isn't room for improvement. After all, Chef Citrin's motto is ""In Pursuit of Excellence."" I think the area that could most use an update is the canap√©s. Now I'm not suggesting they adopt an EMP or Meadowood-style cavalcade approach, but I do think some change would be good, as we've been met with the same amuse for two-and-a-half years. Whether they heed my advice or not, Melisse will remain the best fine-dining restaurant in southern California.

Congratulations, James! And thank you for another enrapturing evening!"
"I'm not one to give two stars to many places, as I really only like rating places that deserve 4-5 stars, since those are the only ones that I remember. However, let me explain the rating that it deserves.

Food- As for taste, I will give it 4.5 stars. I had a Lobster thermidor to start, which was actually pretty phenomenal. Then I had their duck for the main course, and as someone who has had duck at almost every French/New American place I have been to, this dish was just not very impressive. The skin was not crispy, as was mentioned by the waitress, and was also a bit gamey, which is not what I would expect from a duck dish costing $50. Also, the dishes are pretty costly, which doesn't factor much in terms of taste, but value is not great here. However, I would definitely come back here again to try out the different foods. Oh, and I almost forgot, but the breads were awesome.

Decor- Nothing to be noted here. It was very average. I would give it 3 stars. It's actually a bit too casual for me. They could definitely do better. However, props on the wine glasses- Riedel. Definitely a solid play.

Service- This was probably the reason why my rating went from 4-4.5 stars, to a 2 star rating that I am giving it right now. I went to Melisse with my family, and the four of us have been fine dining many a time, and thought the service here was just terrible. To start, the waitress we had was just not very friendly. She spoke to us in this condescending tone, and was just not trained very well in serving at fine dining restaurants.

Furthermore, when we tried to decide on a wine in their very comprehensive wine list, she recommended us a French wine that was supposed to be similar to a Pinot Noir. When I asked to speak to the master sommelier, she refused to bring him over and said she would be able to help us pick a wine. Instead, she brought over a French wine that she said had mainly Pinot grapes in it, and would pair well with our food. Well, after drinking the wine she had recommended, it was obvious, even to a relatively untrained palate that it was not a Pinot, and was a much fuller wine than one that would pair well with our food. That is really just unacceptable; if I am asking to speak with the sommelier, I should be able to consult him for recommendations on the wines that he has. I don't want some amateur waitress who knows little about wine to give me poor recommendations. Oh, and when we went in at 6:30pm, there were maybe 4 or 5 tables seated, so it definitely was not too busy.

Another waiter came to our service, who was a bit friendlier and more humble, and told us he would get the sommelier to speak to us. However, he never showed, and we just left after dinner.

I would go back, but the service really detracted from my overall opinion. The reason I'm giving it two stars is exactly because I did not enjoy my meal as much as I should have, especially with the price I'm paying. Perhaps the general manager will stumble upon this post and send me a message. However, until I try this place again, I'll have to give it 2 stars. Unfortunately, these aren't the 2 Michelin stars that the restaurant has."
"It was very good, unfortunately I can't remember what I had. I left full and possibly tipsy"
"Went here with family, food was as expected, service was wretched. Treated us like garbage."
"I may have an bias opinion being in the food industry. Every single dish needed salt. If I am going to pay $500+ I expect the food to be near perfect. The technical skill and the complexity of food was great, but without salt, everything turns into blah. Service was okay but could feel tension between two of the servers......made things awkward."
"Thank you Melisse for a wonderful anniversary dinner and gift box of chocolate truffles! The service was outstanding and I only have the highest accolades for the staff. I can't believe how much I enjoyed the classic bread roll that the server walked around. Granted we had like 7 different breads to choose from, that bread was just crunchy and chewy in all the right places! To be honest, I'm a bit lazy to type out all the things that we ate, so I'll just summarize and say that every sauce and foam had intense flavor. It was an adventure trying to combine all the different tastes on any one plate."
"I thought the experience was quite amazing and the service of the restaurant was impeccable. The basil bread has got to be one of the memorable side items. We were here for the 10-course tasting menu in a group of 6 people at 6:30pm. We finished around 10:30pm. I have to say my favorite dishes were the amuse bouche/appetizers and dessert, but I wasn't a fan of the main dishes and neither was the other people at our table. For some reason majority of the dishes seemed really strong in a seafood/lobster bisque. The pork I had tasted like chinese pork and nothing too fancy. I did like some of the presentation for the asian fusion dishes, especially the mushroom soup. The dessert was pretty interesting where there was a clear gelatin layer which allowed the flowers to stand up creating a beautiful dish. The caramel dessert was good and like previous posts was very similar to dippin dots, but it got too sweet for me in the end when the brownies, chocolate, and ice cream all started to melt together. Overall, I think the service was definitely excellent and its a nice place to experience high-end dining."
"Honestly, this is the best 2-star Michelin restaurant I have ever been to. I felt like it could almost compare with the French Laundry. Other two star restaurants like Spago, weren't that great- there were bone fragments in the pork chop (it used to be, though). Other two stars like Cyrus up by Healdsburg are too salty. I interestingly find Melisse to be more fulfilling than French Laundry actually. In FL, everything seems to be a sort of art, not that it is bad, but the portions are sooo tiny. At Melisse, though, the portions are of a good size and the price is not too bad considering what you're getting.

My girlfriend and I ordered the ""carte blanche"" which basically means the chef serves you with 13-14 dishes whatever he wants to whip up (and believe me it's good). The carte blanche is 250 per person. Each dish makes you feel like you haven't had enough and you would just like one more bite. It is extremely worth it and for those of us lucky enough to live in the LA area, we're lucky to have Melisse here! Then we wouldn't have to drive up to the SF area for gourmet food, hehe.

One complaint though, is that when I asked for change to tip the valet, the staff (not the servers) were quite impatient and answered a quick, ""they have change outside."" Doesn't affect the experience though, as the food was simply too good to overcome that tiny aspect..."
"Went here with the intention of having the 10 course dinner, however there were some items that contained shellfish and my girlfriend has a shellfish allergy. So we did what anyone with a food allergy would have done, we asked if the chef could substitute another item in place of those which contain shellfish. We were told that was not a possibility since they were too busy (mind you the dining room wasn't even halfway full) and that we had to choose the 4 course menu. What kind of service is that, for a fu*king $600 meal?! They can't accommodate one request? A common one at that.

Additionally, we asked to taste a wine before buying the bottle and was also told that wasn't a possibility by the bar...at this point, we just wanted to leave.

The rest of the meal was decent, nothing spectacular. We ordered the chicken for two for our main course on the waiter's reccomendation- it was mediocre, nothing spectacular. We were nervous about bringing it to the attention the kitchen staff in fear of having them get upset with us, so we just ate it quickly and cancelled our next course. We just wanted to hurry up and get out. Our server on the other hand was really pleasant and attentive. Also, the food that we got was good, but the rest of the experience just plain sucked. Never before have I felt that my business wasn't appreciated at a high end restaurant."
"Before I write a review of this Restaurant I would like to preface this review.
I am a Gourmet Home Chef for the last 31 years , cooking almost every day and making creative and inventive dishes , the reason is because I eat no meat at all just seafood and Vegetarian and Vegan ,On the other hand , My Wife is Vegan so I have to make interesting and tasty dishes for her and Me , most of the times using mock meats, seafood , and other Vegan products that mimic the texture and consistency of meat , seafood, poultry.
One of the criteria I judge a restaurant of this caliber is not only what they can do for me , using everything but meat, but how creative they are regarding my wife's dietary restrictions and especially when it comes to appetizers and Desserts which seem to be the biggest challenges for Chefs and Pastry chefs. That is why before I make reservations in these, The best restaurants of the world , I contact them to let them know My Wife's restrictions and her love of Desserts and to make sure that if they need to get certain ingredients , they would have the time to think about what to make and to be able to get those ingredients that may not be in their kitchen regularly .
Also I would like to mention that some reviews of restaurants of this caliber complain about the price, yes it is super expensive , obscene it can be also said , but when someone goes to a restaurant like this , this is what it is and it has to be accepted that restaurants of this caliber are going to be expensive.
I contacted Melisse about two weeks before the day of our dinner, I was in touch with Aranka who help me to convey our dietary requests to the chef , she was really great at working with the chef to create a Vegan degustation dinner for my wife and a Seafood/Fish degustation dinner for my Mother and me .
What can I say incredible Vegan Menu and the most incredible dessert , My Wife said "" the best dessert she ever had "" and we have been to the best restaurants in the world.
Our Menu was incredible as well , also I would like to commend the whole staff extremely professional and of course Chef De Cusine Ken Takayama ."
"Melisse is a legitimate 4 star experience. But at these prices - budget around $250 per person - it ought to be 5 stars.

I sometimes get the feeling that what is missing is improvisation. The dishes often taste as though its components were largely prepared earlier in the day. This results in an experience that tastes more assembled than cooked."
"Absolutely superb experience from start to finish. If you eat with your eyes first then just take a look at the pictures attached. As for the taste, we kept on having a hard time deciding what was or were our favorite dishes because THEY WERE ALL OUTSTANDING!! Service throughout the night was also impeccable thanks to a well coordinated crew on both kitchen (Chefs Ian & Ken) and dining room (Matthew and Fernando). Our wine pairing (10 wines!!!) was also outstanding and thanks to Matthew who is currently running the wine program, was so enjoyable.

Michelin stars must be awarded to the new Melisse."
"It was an amazing experience! Every dish was better than the other, and every one was as memorable as the other. The wine pairing was perfect. I enjoyed my experience at Melisse.

The lobster bolognesse is a must, and the chocolate chocolate dessert is a must.

Dinner was expensive, but well worth it. Not for penny pincher because they are gonna be the first ones who will tear the food apart.

the food is done with love, care and lots of sophistication. That's my kinda place. Thank you chef, for making my anniversary that much ore memorable. Thank you honey for bringing me to this wonderful place."
"This is the best restaurant in Los Angeles! This is my boyfriend's favorite restaurant so I've been here three times now in the past year. He is pretty much a ""foodie"" so I think that is saying a lot.

The environment there is very laid back and the servers are quite friendly which I really appreciate. Everything here is beyond delicious and so delicately and meticulously assemble by the chef. Eating here is really a treat. I always get champagne when I drink here because it makes everything even more special.


The only thing I don't like about Melisse is the decor...I am giving this place 5 stars...because its Melisse...But I always feel like the interior is a little drab and not super uplifting...But it is very elegant and simple, which I think a lot of people love, and that way the emphasis can be placed on the food, rather than the interior..."
"After being open for years Melisse has tasted success. The elegant country French restaurant has done well: it's easy, none of the old fashioned stuffy waiters or trendy in your face down on their haunches servers. and serves of the best food in the area. Everyone just knows what they're doing--with Panache. If that isn't enough, the ceiling actually opens to the stars and closes in slow motion during the evening!

On opening night Josea, the owner, could be seen approving every dish as it went to a satisfied customer. We experienced the Tasting menu. A signature moment appeared as flavor embraced the palate (or visa versa) and meandered through the taste buds. The egg, soft-boiled in its shell, topped with cauliflower cream, was heavenly--then the unexpected satisfying crunch of osetra caviar completed the masterpiece. Another M-m-m-m-m for the Four Star rated establishment.
.
There's no real scene here, and you can actually hear what the person across from you is saying. The ex-partner Raffe Lunetta can sometimes be seen occupying a table in the center with friends. That's the kind of place it is."
Service is fantastic and the food is sublime love the chef and it's truly a dining experience
worth every cent .. .. everyone who works there has excellent knowledge of the cuisine & wine
Came here a couple months ago and totally forgot to leave a review until now. This place is by far one of the best french restaurants I've been. Melisse is as good as Jean George. I had the pre-fixed meal and it was outstanding. This is a great place for special occasion. The service is just off the top. It's pricey but definitely worth the money.
"Never really thought I'd actually go to this place bring it French with my avoidance of gluten and dairy as well as the price tag, but ended up deciding to go for the dineLA menu this year so we could give it a try. Even though they had mentioned several times while making the reservation and when we sat down that it would be hard to be dairy free, the chefs thoroughly accommodated my dietary restrictions with slight modifications of the menu. Service was good as all the other reviews suggest and the food was good too. They emphasized quality ingredients and presentation, but honestly I did not consider any of the food to taste much better than something you could get at any of the other places in the area. All in all, it was a great experience and I suggest giving it a try at least once to get a taste of a fancier life that's not super pretentious."
"What is there left to say that the other 800+ reviewers haven't already said?! This place is phenomenal. Ordered the ""ten"" + wine pairings. No, it's not cheap. Yes, it's worth it. Every course was better than the last. The service is impeccable (I swear there were at least 6 staff members prepping/cleaning/serving/refilling at all times). I have never been to a Michelin restaurant before, and now I understand what separates these places from other restaurants out there. It's just next-level amazing. Stand outs for me include the caviar egg dish (the first course, possibly the best course), the brie, the flat iron steak, the peach dessert and the corn soup. Even the BREAD AND BUTTER is good, y'all. (There are like 7 different breads to choose from!)

Go here for your next special occasion. Don't worry about the bill. Take your time. Enjoy every bite."
"I almost feel obligated to give this place a high rating simply because it was so fancy (side note: the dress code is business casual so you don't have to wear a ball gown but you should probably not wear a t-shirt with bedazzled shotguns on the back and capri pants).

The service is impeccable. They obviously focus a lot on timing and efficiency, giving each customer their courses as well as clearing plates at the exact same time. They also give a short explanation to every dish which I found very helpful. The atmosphere, with its low lighting and soft voices, is very intimate or at least tries to be but you can't 100% control your customers so I won't fault them there. I AM, however, a little conflicted between loving the efficient service and feeling a little claustrophobic by all the waiters, busboys, managers, etc. weaving through tables or just standing around ready to pounce on any need you might have. Just a matter of individual taste I guess but it did feel a little difficult to have personal conversations.

Moving on to the food. Unless you can eat like a horse, I recommend you go with the 4 course meal, which is what I ordered, or less. The portions are small but boy do they fill you up. I had to take home boxes by the end. Plus, they give you a small starter to wet the appetite, endless gourmet bread (please try to basil brioche!), and a mini-dessert sampler in the end so it was a lot of food. I won't go into too many specifics because doing that for a multi-course meal would result in a short novel and no one has that kind of attention span, especially on yelp. To cut right to the point, everything was delicious. The flavors were rich, complex, and well-balanced, some being more subtle than others. Every component had a purpose, if it wasn't to offer a complimentary flavor, it was to vary the texture of the dish.

In case anyone is curious, I ordered (going from first to last course) the scallops, the lobster bolognese, the venison, and the chocolate ganache tart. The menu seems to change often though so I'm not sure how helpful this will be.

I thoroughly enjoyed my experience, but the price would limit this restaurant to special occasions and anniversaries for me. You have to try this place at least once but I do suggest not eating anything for the entire day to prepare your stomach. I can't wait for the opportunity to try this place again."

Chef and owner of Melisse Josiah Citrin has put together a sophisticated and chic restaurant in Santa Monica. The two Michelin star restaurant forks out contemporary French cuisine. The menu is prix fixe based on fresh ingredients for the week, with some signature items remaining on the menu. The staff handpick the ingredients to offer the best possible dishes for the night. Additionally, Citrin shows confidence in his chef de cuisine Ken Takayama to create dishes that would be suitable to the fine diners.

As soon as you walk through the door, you are taken on a two-three hour journey of scrumptious food and superb service. The ambiance is simple, elegant, with a large chandelier as the main decor. Intricate details make this experience memorable. If you're celebrating a birthday or anniversary, you can expect a little gift courtesy of the restaurant.


MY FAVORITE DISH. EGG CAVIAR: Soft poached egg, lemon creme fraiche, American caviar. This luscious creation was simply, well, orgasmic. The construction of this dish is a masterpiece served in its egg shell (be careful, it can break on you and cause an accident on the tablecloth...). The egg was nicely poached, the creme fraiche had a light citrus flavor and the caviar was delicious. Served with a crispy biscuit, this salty and creamy dish was full of flavor and perfectly balanced. It's a signature dish on the menu.


WAGYU BEEF TARTARE: Smoked tomato emulsion, capers and puffed rice. O.M.G. This was an amazingly delicious beef tartare. It had me at wagyu. It was rich, creamy, with the perfect balance of flavors. The puffed rice was the ideal accompaniment to offer crunch and texture. The only complaint I had with this dish (which is small) was that the smoked tomato emulsion was a bit on the salty end. I'd still eat it nonetheless!


SALMON ROE WITH GELEE: This remarkable salmon eggs had bursts of flavor in your mouth. It was smooth, juicy and was comprehensively a nice dish. If you like the texture of popping boba (but salty), you'll love these little balls!

FOIE GRAS TERRINE: Bluberry, meyer lemon, hazelnut, toasted brioche. I love, love, love foie gras and this dish is no exception. It was smooth and creamy. The blueberry and lemon along with the salt cut through the richness. The brioche added the right amount of sweetness. It was the perfect combination and downright delicious!


LOBSTER BOLOGNESE: Fresh cappelini, basil, brown butter truffle froth. The handmade pasta was cooked al dente and was coated with a rich tomato sauce. The lobster was fresh. The truffle froth added tons of additional flavor to the already exceptional dish.

AMUSE BOUCHE: Orange gelee, fennel panna cotta, vanilla oil and cashew foam. This is a smooth and decadent amuse bouche. From initial plating, you would expect it to be on the sweeter end based on the ingredients. Little did I know that upon first bite, I was taken to a whole new world in terms of taste and palate. If they always start off a meal this good, then you're in for a real treat!


STRAWBERRY DESSERT: Do you like the strawberry pie from Marie Callendar's? Then you'll love this dessert! Inspired by that restaurant's pie, this dessert is the strawberry pie deconstructed with the finest flavors. It isn't super sweet and Melisse picked the ripest strawberries around. Cool, refreshing and light.


PINEAPPLE SOUFFLE: I absolutely love souffles! Many restaurants fail to get it right, but Melisse surprised me in every way possible. The beautifully standing souffle was filled with freshly diced pineapple in the middle topped with a vanilla and lime zest concoction. It was sweet and well balanced. The perfect way to end a perfect night.

Overall, Melisse presents dishes that are beautifully plated and sophisticated on the palate. There is a lot of work that goes into dishing out a menu like Melisse. The menu is well thought out with precision in each and every dish. Melisse does not offer one simple menu each night, but various ones from vegetarian to their four course meal and all the way to a ten course meal all distinct from each other. What I love about this restaurant is the fact that the majority of the staff have been with Citrin for 15 years plus. The staff is aware of the ins and outs of this exceptional establishment. The fact that the runners/waiters are the ones expediting the food, not the executive chef is unique to most restaurants. Citrin trusts his staff and vice-versa. Would I come back again? Definitely! Word of advice: It can be a bit pricey and it's not an everyday affair to fork out $500+ for two people (but it was well-worth it)!"
"All I can say is, wow! We had the dineL.A. takout meal today, which included poached oysters, sweet pea soup, sea bass, duck, strawberries and cream, and a roll. Every single item was outstanding. I thought the dessert would just be ok, because it didn't sound half as special as it was. This is one of the best meals I've ever had outside of France."
"As a very picky eater when it comes to French food, it's really something when I say Melisse is by far the BEST French restaurant I've dined at in SoCal.

Being a Michelin 2-star restaurant, the food is obviously good. But the best part is, the menu is not ridiculously priced like some ""fine dining restaurants"" here in L.A. $150 for the 10 course tasting menu by the owner Josiah Citrin is actually really reasonable. It's almost like $10-$15 per dish. Also my best bet if I'm looking to impress guests in town.

The interior is bright and modern, while the purple walls add a little ""prettiness"" to the dining room. It's not a huge restaurant, but perfectly sized for prompt service.

Now a list of my favorite dishes:
1) Of course, their signature appetizer: Egg Caviar.
I love how they are so generous with their caviar! Not shady like many French restaurants.
2) Seared Foie Gras.
This is my ULTIMATE favorite. Best foie gras I have tasted in California. It's perfectly cooked: slightly crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. Mmm.. just recalling the taste of this dish makes me want to call Melisse to make a reservation right now.
3) Prime Beef Rib Eye and Braised Cheek.
Very tender and perfectly seasoned. Not too heavy.

Like all of the best restaurants in the world, Melisse is wonderful but not perfect. The only shortcoming I've noticed so far would be the frequency and magnitude of change in their menu. They do make a point to emphasize that their menus are seasonal. However, based on my 8 visits to Melisse, the food is consistent but almost always the same that it has started to get a little boring :( Maybe this only applies to Chef Josiah's menu since I've been a loyal fan. I understand that they do keep many signature dishes on the menu to keep the following.

Well, all in all, I would say that my number of visits may double by the end of this year!"
"DineLA Jan 2017 Review

I came to this restaurant several years late after all the fanfare and rave reviews yet I felt they still have a grasp on their good reputation. Any criticisms enclosed in this review are minor and only written out to provide as much information as possible for reader, as coming to this place will be at a considerable expense to you so we want to make sure you get a complete picture. The experience on the whole was one of the best dinner services I've had in Los Angeles.

Food: DineLA menu offerings were reasonable this year. It has the same items on the regular menus, the only difference being a limitation on the breadth of choice. Presentation was top notch and pacing was done at an attentive scale. Portions run small but because of pacing, one finds themselves unexpectedly full.

One of us had the wine pairing ($85 supplement in addition to $99 menu) and for them, it was worth it although there were others who felt that for that price, we may as well have ordered from the regular menu.

Bread: they are very generous with the bread here unlike Spago. They give you whatever you want and will provide recommendations as to which one to pair with each dish if you care for it. Our favourite was the green Basil bread and bacon cornmeal. We recommend getting the basil bread as much as you can as it is a popular choice and they tend to run out of it quickly. Some in our party felt the bread was too tough and cold but this was limited to personal preferences.

Amuse Bouche: the same grape jelly and grape goat cheese shell encrusted with pistachios. I did not take a photo of this because there are already uploaded by other users. Our table judged it as unremarkable and felt it was not an accurate representation of their menu theme but it was a nice treat to try nonetheless.

Naked Cowboy Oyster: it is a smaller version of the original and served in a shell. This was a very light, elegant dish with beautiful features of caviar and superbly picked out oyster. I could have done without the gazpacho because it tasted too acidic and thick against the oyster's oceanic saltiness but others really enjoyed this one.

Chestnut Soup: rich, creamy, and svelte. The black truffle mousse elevated this into something sublime and quite special. The earthy undertones of mushroom and chestnuts were appropriate for the deep winter. If only we had more!

Wild New Zealand Tai Snapper: unfortunately this was the one dish we all unanimously disliked. It's a cold gelatinous mishmash of seafood stuck together in a confusing mosaic. You can't even taste the snapper. It is entirely reminiscent of aspic so for more mature diners, this may be a welcome retreat to the past but for younger ones, it will be met with real disappointment.

Caramelised Alaskan Cod: (I did not take a photo of this because there are already uploaded by other users). For a humble substitute, it was cooked outstandingly with a great sear and perfectly tender whilst all the other aspects complemented the dish.

Lamb Loin: the meat was cooked beautifully and the spinach was a great addition but for me, the lemon thyme jus made everything really sour. The tomato confit drowned in it to the point that I couldn't taste it or how well it went together with the dish.

Prime Rib: this was a crowd favourite and was recommended to us to be done medium rare. The suggestion was on point as the meat was tender and flavourful. The red wine sauce was a wow factor and really made the dish stand out

Cara Cara Orange: a very pretty and decadent dessert with airy ingredients and candied flower petals to showcase the citrusy taste that ended the dinner on a pleasing note.

P√©tit Fours: a charming selection of sweets that Melisse offers on special occasions. It tends to stay the same four types but they change out the flavours of the jellies and macaroons dependent on the season.

Coffee and Tea: their coffees are simple hot brews, not flat but fresh tasting. Their teas are high quality and include more unusual flavours like lavender and white rose. Melisse is extremely generous and brings a very large pot which can serve up to 8-12 cups so plenty of refills for large groups.

Service: the servers, maitre'd, and sommelier were all very accomplished; their manners were exceptional and were never pretentious. They were extremely attentive and really ensure that the guests are enjoying themselves. Our water glasses were continually refilled and we never once had to prompt them for anything.

Ambiance: on the outside, the restaurant is located in an unassuming area of Santa Monica and far from the touristy Promenade. Inside, it is a small but modern space with sleek furnishings"
I had valentines dinner here. The service and food was exquisite. I enjoyed every minute of it.
"Daddy would be so proud M√©lisse.

A month later, not the day after as I was told in person, I was contacted by a ""manager"" of some sort.

It was clear from the beginning that she could care less about making anything right or show any care to what happened. Let alone an apology for the very POOR customer service and communication.

I was offered $100 for the bar.

So for a table of $2,400 of which we never even finished and walk out of... that was their resolution.

To M√©lisse, $100 is FAIR.

Stir away from these clowns, who make clown food and charges you an arm and a leg like the clowns they are."
"First, lets get the rating out of the way. this is a 5 star establishment, period. There were a couple of things that could have been better but still, a beautiful restaurant, amazing food (both flavor & and presentation), top notch service that was attentive and personable (thank you Lauren) equals - 5 stars.

1st course - fois grad and egg caviar were delicious and the wine pairing with my food grad was out of this world (late harvest chenin blanc).

2nd course - lobster Bolognese with strong and balanced flavors - absolutely spectacular

3rd course - Japanese Weigu was delicious, but in my humble opinion a bit too small of a cut. I completely understand that Japanese Kobe is a much more expensive piece of meat than the N.Y which was the other steak meat option. But there was $65 up charge for it so 2-3 more ounces would have been more fair.

4th course - Fromage - amazing, especially the Blue and the tripple creme - wow!!

5th course - Pineapple souffle. Had plenty of souffles in my life, including a gorgeous chocolate souffle at Joel Robuchon a few months a go and this pineapple souffle was one of the best.

By the way, I did get the $95 wine pairing and I highly reccomend this option rather than bringing your own bottle since the sommelier's pairings are perfect and truly enhanced every dish I had.

Now, for all of you melisse lovers that have decided to protest the 3% health tax, I understand raising an eyebrow since I am not a fan of the ACA to say the least, but come on now. This restaurant is a gem in a city that does not have many Michelin rated restaurants so don't let politics spoil your fun."
"Out of all the times that the Mr. and I have dined here , it's always such a pleasant surprise every single time because their tasting menu is AWESOME! (for those of you who have seen the LEGO movie that was a nod to the film!)

I love places that has little stools by the table for lady's purses for some reason.

We went here for Valentine's Day and I have to say it was no different than all the other times the Mr and I had dined there in the past. Meaning we didn't have to deal with picking between just three entrees just for that evening, wait long past our reservation times, or feel like we are rushed because they have to get the next herd of people in since it's Valentine's Day. Instead at Melisse it was just business as usual. Their taste menu changes so there's no point in going through what I had as most likely it won't be there the next time I'm there. However, that's the novelty of this establishment is that it REALLY is like a box of chocolate - you never know what you're going to get!

During dinner Chef Josiah came by to say ""hello"" and my husband told the chef how pleased he was that this was the first Valentine's Day dinner where my husband didn't feel like he was part of an assembly line. The chef said that they kept the layout of the restaurant relatively the same because they didn't want people to feel packed in or rushed (my guess is they just raised their prices higher than usual for days like Valentine hahaha)

Be prepared to spend no less than $500 per couple when dining here, but so worth it! And book advance as it's a popular place for celebrations, dates for the LA crowd.

Cheers!"
"Food/pairing/service was excellent but holy smokes, $700 for a 4 course dinner for 2.. $$$$$$$$$"
